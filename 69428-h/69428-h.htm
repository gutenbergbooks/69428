</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> very early days,
in the beginnings of Saxon Christianity, a certain Saxon potentate
erected a church at Wellfield, now a village in the north-east
corner of a great and wealthy English county.
This church he called, as many churches in
those times were called, the White Church;
and since it stood in a peculiar situation, in
close proximity to the foot of a lovely wooded
rise, he added the further distinguishing title
of ‘under the Hill,’ and for hundreds of years
it was known as the ‘White Church under

<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>

the Hill.’ Generations came and went, and
worshipped there, and led lives pious or
otherwise: it was a wild race of people that
dwelt in that well-watered valley, and the
White Church under the Hill was known far
and wide, long before such things as monasteries
and cloisters, with their attendant good
and evil, were thought of. It was a wild and
lovely region, watered by three fair streams
well stocked with fish, while venison and
game abounded in the woods and on the
moors around. Gradually a village clustered
around the White Church. Wealthy and
pious persons made gifts to it, and built
houses in the vicinity of it, until the Normans
came, and soon after that changes took place.
Monasteries and abbeys and nunneries sprang
up, here and there, throughout the land; and
it so chanced that a certain pious baron presented
to a company of Cistercian monks a
very fair site by the river, and not far from
the White Church. There they began to
build themselves an abbey, the fame of which
soon spread far and wide in the land. Its

<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>

farms were fat, its lands productive, its
abbots proud, its hospitality unbounded; for
three centuries they built at it and lavished
upon it all manner of beauty, in the shape of
rare carvings of oak and stone. Its church
was as large as many a cathedral; it stood
on an exquisite site beside the river, and the
size of the abbey-grounds soon exceeded that
of the whole village and the White Church
counted into the bargain. Then, while it was
still in its glory and still unfinished, while the
proudest and most domineering of its abbots
was ruling the land around with a rod of iron,
and hunting out witches and chasing them
over Penhull, the great hill hard by, and
burning them when he caught them, and was
rioting in power—then, under the ferocious
auspices of the Eighth Harry of glorious
memory, a reform was effected—a reform
which took the shape of a sack of the
glorious abbey. Its church was demolished,
the friars disbanded, the proud abbot was
gibbeted in full view of his birthplace over
the water, on a wooded mound called to this

<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>

day ‘The Abbot’s Knoll.’ All the church
plate and jewellery was confiscated by the
royal robber; while the abbey and the lands
thereof were magnanimously presented by
him—what was left of them—to two of the
neighbouring gentry, one John de Wellfield
and one Ralph de Burnshire, which
gentlemen had gallantly espoused the cause
of the king, and had assisted in driving
forth the monks from the abbey at the end
of the pike. The families of Wellfield and
Burnshire presently were united by the marriage
of the sole heiress of the Burnshires
with the sole heir of the Wellfields, and it was
at this juncture that another great property
called Brentwood, some three miles away,
lapsed, through lack of direct heirs male,
from the Burnshire family to a collateral
branch of the same, named Waddington,
which Waddingtons continued to be devout
Roman Catholics, while the Wellfields turned
heretics, to the great distress of the reverend
fathers, the Jesuits, who about this period in
the family history were beginning to make a

<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>

great noise in the world, and to exert their
power and make it felt. Wellfield Abbey,
then, got into heretic hands, and the heretics
continued to be men of mark; while the
pious and devout Waddingtons had the ill
luck (or the ill grace) to die out, and their
representatives, in the year of grace 1794,
let their ancient abode on the hill-side at a
nominal rent to those Jesuit fathers who
were driven from their French college at
L—— by the Revolution.  They were
thrifty, these Jesuit fathers, and eventually
bought the whole estate, and their representatives
possess it to this day, and have made of
it the first Roman Catholic seminary in the
north at any rate, if not in the whole of England.
Indeed, that corner of this favoured
land is a Catholic stronghold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the heretic Wellfields of Wellfield
continued to flourish, seemingly, like a
green bay-tree; though, taking the royalist
side in the Stuart troubles, they are said to
have suffered heavy losses therefrom. The
most perfect <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entente cordiale</i> always existed

<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>

between them and the neighbouring Catholic
gentry, and the reverend fathers at Brentwood;
and they were always classed amongst
the first families of the neighbourhood when
they were at home. Of late years they had
lived much abroad. At the time now
referred to, 18—, there were only two
representatives of the line: John Felix
Wellfield, and a son; the said John Felix
had been an only child, as had his father
before him, and his own wife was recently
dead.</p>

<p>Meantime, while the gorgeous abbey
church, which had been centuries a-building,
had been so razed to the ground as that
hardly a vestige of it remained, save a green
space in the shape of a cross to show where
it had once stood, and while the two great
entrances of the abbey—Monk’s-gate and
Abbot’s-gate—were like great ruined caverns,
grown over with ivy; while the cloisters were
a line of hoary ruins, and nought of the
abbey remained save enough to make a
quaint old dwelling-house—all this time the

<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>

White Church under the Hill stood intact—added
to a little here and there; enriched by
the spoils of the abbey—they rescued the
exquisite carved black oak stalls and a magnificent
rood-screen, and set them up in the
humbler building. Now it was a Protestant
place of worship; in the midst of the old oak
pews some evangeliser had set up a ‘three-decker,’
in which the service was performed,
and there is no record of this piece of vandalism
having met with the condign punishment
it deserved. It—the ‘three-decker’—stared
down upon an ancient pew of black
carved oak which glittered like a mirror,
which pew was said—along with many others—to
be the oldest in England. Built by one
Roger of Wellfield, it had been left by him
as a legacy for ‘the proud dames of Wellfield’
to sit in every Sunday, which ‘proud
dames’ are at this date represented by three
decrepit old women, who enjoy the best view
in the church of—the pulpit. The old church
is sturdy yet, having survived so many
changes, including a visit from George Fox,

<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>

in the days when he went about denouncing
‘steeple-houses,’ and who stood in the aisle
and stigmatised the then priest of Wellfield
as ‘a light, scornful, chaffy fellow.’ It shows
no signs of decay. May it be long before
such symptoms appear in it!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A party of visitors, thirty years ago and
more, were strolling round this old church one
summer afternoon, escorted by a young woman
who had the keys, and who had told them all
she knew about the place and its history.</p>

<p>‘Then does the present Mr. Wellfield not
live at the abbey?’ inquired a young lady
who was of the party.</p>

<p>‘No, ma’am. They say he lives a deal in
Italy, and the lady he married came from
those parts. Young Mr. Wellfield is staying
at the abbey now, and his tutor says it’s
because of his health; but they do say that
Mr. Wellfield is going to be married again,
and wants him away.’</p>

<p>The visitors exchanged glances, and the
young woman continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>‘See, there’s the young gentleman looking
in now, and his playfellow, old Mr. Leyburn’s
lad.’</p>

<p>Indeed, at this moment two boys, whose
ages might be ten and eleven, or eleven and
twelve years, came strolling into the church
by the chancel door, which stood open, their
arms about one another’s shoulders, and their
faces rubbing together now and then after
the fashion of a couple of friendly ponies.
One was tall and slender, and was of an
extraordinary beauty of face and figure, with
solemn, liquid dark eyes, and a very un-English
look. The other was not quite so
tall, was sturdy, square and strong, but
clumsily built—‘a little <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pleb</i>,’ thought the
young lady, who was watching them with
interest. The rest of her party had strolled
on with the young woman to look at proud
Abbot ——’s tombstone, which, said
tradition, if a Wellfield walked over it, he
should not live out the year. But the girl—she
was no more—remained where she was
until the boys came up to her, and they were

<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>

all standing at the foot of the chancel steps,
just outside the rood-screen.</p>

<p>‘Have you come to see the church?’ she
asked, smiling.</p>

<p>‘We saw the door open, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">signorina</i>, and
came in,’ said the beautiful boy; ‘but we can
see it as often as we want—twice every
Sunday.’</p>

<p>His voice was sweet; his accent more than
half Italian.</p>

<p>‘Do you live here then? What is your
name?’ she asked, wishing to draw him
out.</p>

<p>‘No; I do not live here. I am only staying
a few months here. I am called Jerome
Wellfield, and the abbey belongs to my
father.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! Would you not like to live in
such a beautiful home?’</p>

<p>‘If it were not so cold in England I would;
but I like Italy: it is warm there.’</p>

<p>‘Yes.  And you—what are you called?’
she asked, turning to the other lad.</p>

<p>‘John Leyburn,’ he made answer, looking

<span class="pagenum">[</span>

at her with clear, considerate, rather light-brown
eyes, which looked very ineffective
beside the velvet softness and darkness of
young Wellfield’s.</p>

<p>‘You live here, I am sure.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I live at Abbot’s Knoll with my
father and mother.’</p>

<p>‘And are you great friends? Have you
known one another long?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! we have known one another a long
time—two months,’ replied young Wellfield;
‘and we are great friends, aren’t we, Jack?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied ‘Jack,’ with much deliberation.</p>

<p>Indeed all he did and said was deliberate.</p>

<p>‘And can you tell me what each of you
likes better than anything else?’ she asked,
loth to break off the conversation, and
charmed with Master Jerome’s grace and
beauty. ‘You, Jerome Wellfield, what do
you like best?’</p>

<p>‘I like so many things that are nice,’ said
the boy, with a pensive smile; and glancing
downwards, the long lashes swept his pale

<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>

cheek. ‘I like music; and I liked mamma.
I liked her drawing-room at Frascati, where
the beautiful ladies used to come when I was
a little boy. I like—oh! I like everything
that is not ugly,’ he concluded, looking rather
bored.</p>

<p>‘And you, my boy?’ she turned to the
other.</p>

<p>‘I like birds’-nesting,’ was the reply, deliberate,
but prompt.</p>

<p>‘What, better than anything? Oh, horrible!’</p>

<p>‘He does not mean birds’-nesting, exactly,’
Jerome explained for him. ‘He means all
sorts of things—going into the woods, and
learning about birds and watching them, and
plants, and butterflies, and all that sort of
thing.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, natural history!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; natural history,’ replied the sturdy-looking
boy.</p>

<p>‘I don’t care for the birds in the woods
here,’ said Jerome, carelessly; ‘ugly little
brown things! I liked the golden pheasants,

<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>

and the scarlet humming-birds, and the big
white macaw, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">papagei</i>—parrot, you
know—in Countess Necromi’s aviary.’</p>

<p>‘Laura, my dear, we must go. We have
to do Brentwood yet, you know, and then to
drive to the Lathebys.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I suppose we have. Well, boys,
good afternoon. Will you shake hands with
me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">signorina</i>. <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">À rivederci</i>,’ said young
Wellfield, looking so enchantingly amiable
that Miss Laura stooped and kissed him.</p>

<p>‘Since you say <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">à rivederci</i>, I suppose you
do not count me as an ugly thing?’ she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, the very opposite!’ he smiled,
and she tapped his cheek, and said he was
a precocious boy. She felt no interest in poor
John Leyburn, but being of a kind disposition
held out her hand to him too. He
flushed all over his plain young face, and
asked:</p>

<p>‘Will you—would you tell me what you
are called?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>With a rapid flash of intuition ‘Laura’
realised that with all Jerome’s pretty words
and liquid glances, he had not troubled
himself on this point. She put her hand on
the plain boy’s shoulder, and kissed him too,
saying:</p>

<p>‘My name is Laura Dewhirst. By the
time you are grown up you will have forgotten
it, and I shall be such an old woman
that you would not know me if you met
me.’</p>

<p>All three laughed, and with another nod
to the boys Miss Dewhirst ran after her
papa and mamma. The two boys left the
church, and the young woman locked the
door and contemplated the gratuity she had
received with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Where shall we go?’ asked Jerome.</p>

<p>‘To Mr. Philips, to do our Latin.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Latin!’ sighed the boy. ‘I never
used to do any Latin when mamma was
alive—before I came to England.’</p>

<p>‘Would you like to go back to Italy?’</p>

<p>‘Not much, because papa always makes

<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>

me feel such a very little boy. Mr. Philips
doesn’t.’</p>

<p>‘Well, come along then! Was not that
a beautiful lady?’</p>

<p>‘Very pretty. She liked talking to us.’</p>

<p>‘I liked talking to her,’ said John Leyburn,
sedately, as they turned in at the abbey
gate, and went up the river walk.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was half-past nine in the evening.
The concert in the great Saal of
the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kurhaus</i> at Ems was just
over, and the audience streamed out, with a
clatter of conversation, and a sudden restoration
of animation, into the fresher and yet
deliciously warm air of the gardens. It was
the end of July, the height of the season
at Ems; and that small, enervating, fashionable
watering-place was thronged with
visitors of every age, nation, and rank, from
the royal and imperial, as represented in the

<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>

persons of Germany and Russia, down to the
English family of Robinson, who had never
felt so genteel before, or been in (whether
of or not) such aristocratic company in their
lives, and the German family of Braun, who
were wealthy, and who revelled luxuriously
each day at a different <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">table d’hôte</i> of a
different hotel, and who sat in a row in the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kurgarten</i>, morning and afternoon, listening
devotedly to the music, and occasionally
murmuring ‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Schön!</i>’ if it pleased them. Or,
oh joy! standing in rapt respect and attention,
as an old white-headed, white-moustached
man in a grey summer-suit came
walking along, very erect, one hand behind
his back, in friendly converse with, now one,
now another, bare-headed gentleman who
kept just a pace behind him.</p>

<p>‘There’s the emperor! <em>dear</em> old thing!’
whisper all the Miss Robinsons, standing up
too, as the grey old gentleman comes past.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Unser Kaiser!</i>’ murmur the Brauns with
beaming smiles of satisfaction, and gazing at
him with broad-faced loyalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>This ‘watching for the emperors,’ and the
thrills of emotion which ran through every
loyal heart when they were visible, was the
chief pastime of the day; and if one failed to
see the emperors, there were always those
who had lived near them—princesses, countesses,
baronesses, and their consorts; highnesses
of every degree of transparency and
serenity, half the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">vons</i> in the Almanach
de Gotha; together with unpronounceable
Russians, fascinating Poles, well-known diplomatists,
representing both the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">suaviter in
modo</i> and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fortiter in re</i>—to wit, the ‘blood
and iron’ policies of their respective courts.
All these were there, besides the shoals of
nobodies who bought up the <cite>Kurlisten</cite> in
order to read their own names in close proximity
to those of somebodies, and who, it is to
be hoped, felt rewarded by these and similar
privileges for the crowding and pushing and
swindling to which they were in other matters
subjected.</p>

<p>On the night in question the concert-room
had been thronged, for the two emperors and

<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>

their suites had condescended to look in for a
few moments, and the orchestra had performed
the Russian national hymn with great spirit
and much applause. The distinguished guests
were felt to be still lingering somewhere about
the gardens; and moreover the river was
illuminated, and was dazzling with lines of
fairy lights, from the bridge opposite the
Darmstädter Hof to the other bridge at the
extreme end of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kurgarten</i>—and of civilisation,
of course, in Ems—and beyond the house
called the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vier Thürme</i>, at which the Russian
monarch was lodging.</p>

<p>Two barges, brightly illuminated with
the imperial crowns and lovingly-entwined
initials of Russia and Germany, were floating
about the river, while ‘the music’ on
board alternately played <cite>Die Wacht am Rhein</cite>
and the Russian national anthem—a spectacle
most thrilling and edifying for all loyal souls;
if somewhat less enchanting to the musicians
and boatmen who perspired in the glare and
smell and heat of the lamps, and industriously
paddled up and down the little Lahn,

<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>

below the walls of the broad walk of the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kurgarten</i>.</p>

<p>Down that broad walk, from the concert-room,
came a crowd of the notabilities and
otherwise, who had composed the audience;
all chattering, laughing, flirting, and intriguing
in almost every European tongue.</p>

<p>About the middle of the throng came a
group of some four or five ladies and gentlemen,
and walking a little in advance of the
others with one of the men beside her, a tall
girl whose accent was English, though she
spoke German. Some dark thick trees overhung
that part of the walk, making it dark on
the side next the river wall; but the lamps
cast a bright light upon the girl’s face, and
showed its every feature and the play of its
expression clearly and distinctly to one who
sat on a bench in one of the little recesses in
the wall which almost overhung the river; and
who from this position had for some time been
indifferently watching the brilliant throng as
they trooped past.</p>

<p>As the girl came on, now looking straight

<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>

before her, now turning her head to speak to
the man, who from the thickness of the crowd
was compelled to go just half a pace behind
her, the hidden watcher observed her closely
and intently. She was tall, well-formed, and
well-developed. There was much grace and
a great deal of pride in her carriage; her head
was habitually carried high, as might easily be
seen; her face was very handsome indeed,
even splendid, with a brow like Chaucer’s
nun:</p>

<div class="poetry-container32">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="blockquot">
     <div class="verse first-line">‘And sickerly she had a fayre forehead,</div>
     <div class="verse">It was almoste a spanne brode, I trow,</div>
     <div class="verse">For hardily she was not undergrowe.’</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>A large, well-cut mouth, in the sweep of
whose lips there was both thought and
grandeur; bright, glossy, chestnut hair, rich
in hue and crisply waving; fine dark-grey
eyes, with level brows, the eyes deep-set and
critical in expression; her whole aspect was
dignified, and yet there was assuredly a gleam
of humour in her eyes, as she stepped composedly
on, in her light, softly falling dress
and broad plumed black hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>‘Tell me, Herr von Lemde—you have
made a study of the nobility, I know——’</p>

<p>‘It is true, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">mein Fräulein</i>. What ought a
man to study, if not his own order?’</p>

<p>‘And that <em>such</em> an order! Indeed, you are
right. I want to know who that lovely
woman near us was, in a dress like a cloud
of creamy muslin and lace. I thought she
must be a Pole, from her gracefulness and
from the spirited way in which she spoke.’</p>

<p>‘You were right,’ he said earnestly. ‘It
was the Princess ——.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you very much. I feel happier
now. Suppose it had turned out to be some
Mrs. Smith, or Frau Müller!’</p>

<p>‘I fear, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">mein Fräulein</i>, that you are a little
tinged with——’</p>

<p>‘But, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">liebe</i> Sara,’ cried a lady behind, ‘it is
getting late, and we have such a long drive.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Carla, don’t go yet!’ expostulated,
not Sara, but a German girl, dark, handsome,
and defiant-looking. ‘It is so fine; and we
have not seen the emperor, and, after all, it
is not so late.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, it is quite early!’ said an English
girl who was of the party.</p>

<p>She addressed as Sara at this moment
turned, and the whole group paused, a few
paces from the place where the silent watcher
sat. He had turned aside as soon as Sara
had passed, and was now gazing intently
down into the mysterious eddies of the river,
his chin propped on his hand.</p>

<p>‘Just as you like, Gräfin,’ said Sara Ford,
smiling; ‘it is very nice here, and Herr von
Lemde’s society makes dullness out of the
question.’</p>

<p>Evidently Miss Ford, dignified though she
looked, was not above amusing herself at the
expense of a rather stupid young man.</p>

<p>Baron Lemde smiled all over his handsome,
meaningless face, and dropped a little into
the rear, embracing Miss Ford’s shawl with
effusion, while she stood, still the centre of
the group, and the Countess of Trockenau
paused, looking thoughtful.</p>

<p>‘It is too bad of you, Miss Ford,’ said the
other English girl in her ear. ‘How can you

<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>

make fun of poor Lemde and make others
laugh at him in that way?’</p>

<p>Sara smiled a bright, frank, disdainful
smile, and the Countess of Trockenau said:</p>

<p>‘Well, shall we be going?’</p>

<p>‘Oh—h—h!’ sighed the younger English
girl, with an accent of disappointment.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mein Fräulein</i>,’ began Lemde, bending
towards Sara, who neither heard nor saw him;
or if she did, did not notice him.</p>

<p>He saw that her eyes were fixed upon
some one who approached them; her lips were
gravely set, yet in their sweet and gracious
curve there was an expression which, though
it was not for him, made the simple young
baron’s heart beat faster. His glance followed
hers. The silent watcher had arisen
from his hiding-place, and was advancing
towards them. He met Sara Ford’s eyes,
and took off his hat. In another moment
they were shaking hands, and though she
was self-possessed, and almost distant in her
manner, poor Hans von Lemde’s heart fell.</p>

<p>‘Good-evening, Miss Ford.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>‘Good-evening, Mr. Wellfield. I did not
see you at the concert. Were you not
there?’</p>

<p>‘No; I have been sitting here by the
river instead. I hope you are well?’</p>

<p>‘Quite well, I thank you. And your——’</p>

<p>The countess had seen and accosted him,
and he turned towards her.</p>

<p>‘You stay late to-night, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">gnädige Frau</i>,’
said he, kissing her hand with sedate gravity.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wellfield! ah, that reminds me—your
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Herr Vater</i>, how is he—any better?
I sent one of my men to inquire while we
were in the concert, but have not seen him
yet.’</p>

<p>She was a very pretty woman of eight or
nine and twenty—a small, brilliant brunette;
and Jerome Wellfield was dark too, yet the
contrast between them was a startling one.</p>

<p>‘I thank you,’ he answered; ‘my father is
somewhat stronger to-night. I trust he will
soon be quite well again.’</p>

<p>‘I hope so; and your sister, she is not with
you to-night?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>‘Avice—she did not wish to leave my
father; and then, she is a child as yet.’</p>

<p>‘Is she? I should have said—What is it?’</p>

<p>‘See, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">liebe</i> Trockenau, his majesty is
coming,’ said a German lady of the party,
and with a quick movement the group was
divided.</p>

<p>The German ladies, being both of rank,
and <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">geborenen</i> of distinguished families, and
Hans Lemde, stood stock-still by the roadside,
waiting until the emperor should pass,
to make their reverences and receive a recognition;
while the English girls, Jerome
Wellfield, and a German man who was not a
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">von</i>, strolled off down a side-walk. Sara Ford
and Jerome Wellfield insensibly, but as if by
general consent, dropped a little behind. The
underlying sparkle of malice and mockery
had died out of the young lady’s eyes, as she
turned to her companion, saying:</p>

<p>‘I am glad your father is better, Mr.
Wellfield, for I had heard that he was
very ill.’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind.  He really does seem

<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>

better to-night, and I am in hopes that the
attack will pass over, as all the others have
done, though it has certainly been a severer
one than usual.’</p>

<p>‘You look as if you had been watching
and sitting up—have you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, a mere trifle. My father gets
nervous, and, as you may easily imagine,
a large hotel is not the most comfortable
place in which to be taken ill.’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Avice insisted on my coming out to-night.
And you, Miss Ford, are you enjoying yourself
at Count Trockenau’s?’</p>

<p>‘Very much. The change from the hot,
dusty town, and from my paint-smelling atelier
is really delightful. Everything up at Trockenau
is so fresh, and the society is very
amusing—yes, really exceedingly amusing.’</p>

<p>Sara laughed as she spoke—a pleasant,
round, though not loud laugh.</p>

<p>‘Herr von Lemde’s society makes dulness
out of the question,’ said Wellfield, composedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>Miss Ford reddened a little.</p>

<p>‘Oh, did you hear all that? Well, who
could be dull with Herr von Lemde? So
long as I know that I may quit his society
whenever I choose, he is delightfully
amusing; and if I knew that I had to endure
his society whether I liked it or not, I
should at once become desperate, and capable
of any crime, I think, so that in any case
dulness is out of the question.’</p>

<p>Wellfield laughed.</p>

<p>‘How long are you staying?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Another week, I think, at least.  The
countess is very kind, and will not hear of
my leaving sooner. You, I suppose, will
remain with your father?’</p>

<p>‘I shall remain with my father at present,’
he answered.</p>

<p>There was a pause as they paced along
the side-walk, somewhat removed from the
glare of the lamps, and felt, each with a
different degree of intensity, that they were
alone. The other girls and their companions
had fallen behind, and the countess

<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>

and the others had not yet come up, glorified
and hallowed by their interview with
their Imperial Master.</p>

<p>Sara Ford, beautiful, talented, and charming,
was an artist, almost alone in the
world, fatherless, motherless, and with very
little money, but with great talent and high
ambition. She was spending her holiday at
the country house, near Nassau, of the Count
and Countess of Trockenau, her fast friends,
and almost her only rich or distinguished
patrons. Jerome Wellfield, who walked by
her side, was the heir to an old name and a
fair estate, of whose beauty she had heard him
speak in terms which, with him, might pass for
enthusiastic. This enthusiasm was the result
of a visit to the said house years ago, when he
had been a mere child, and so deep had been
the impression then made upon him by the
beauty and desirableness of the house of his
fathers, that he was firmly resolved, far from
following his father’s example of absenteeism,
to settle there as soon as conveniently might
be. His acquaintance with Sara Ford had

<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>

not been a very long one; he had met her
at the Countess of Trockenau’s house about
a month ago, during the first part of her
visit; yet, even now, neither ever saw the
other without feeling a secret thrill of joy.
As they silently walked on, she suddenly
looked up at him, almost involuntarily—for
though she was ‘more than common tall,’ he
had somewhat to bend his head to speak to
her—and found his dark, sombre, and, as she
felt, most beautiful eyes, fixed upon her face.
She blushed a little, and sighed quickly. His
face, like some exquisite ivory cameo in its
perfect outlines, and in the still, severe beauty
of its contours, haunted her with a persistence
which would not be accounted for merely by
the fact that she, as an artist by nature and by
trade, must delight in all things beautiful.
For it was not all delight, far from it, which
she felt in the haunting presence of that face.
There was delight, but even more strongly
there was the sense of captivity, the intuitive
consciousness that she, like Gretchen, might
make her moan:</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Did you enjoy the concert?’ asked
Jerome, suddenly, after that long look which
had passed between them.</p>

<p>‘Yes, in a way. I don’t much care for the
music they have at places like this, but it
was better than usual to-night. But I prefer
our homely Elberthal concerts—so far as
music is concerned. Here one goes to look
at the people and the dresses, and to hear
the gossip, and very amusing it is. I think
you don’t go much to the concerts?’</p>

<p>‘No! I really cannot stand the everlasting
waltzes and mazurkas and operatic selections.
And one gets so tired of watching the
same affected, overdressed women and insipid-looking
men engrossed in one another.’</p>

<p>‘Yesterday the countess and I were sitting
in the gardens, when we saw a man and
woman coming along.  The woman was
dressed most gorgeously, and could scarcely

<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>

walk because of her high heels; she hobbled
along looking pitiful. He was a tall, strong,
robust-looking fellow, and he carried her
shawl, and her parasol, and her little bag
with her handkerchief and scent-bottle, and
he led her little white dog along by a blue
ribbon; and he seemed happy.’</p>

<p>Wellfield laughed a little contemptuously.</p>

<p>‘I can imagine a man, if he were weak-minded,
descending to even that depth, for
the sake of some woman,’ continued Sara,
reflectively. ‘What I cannot understand is,
that any woman should like him for doing it;
should be gratified in seeing him acting the
part of a lady’s-maid to her. But I have
seen many things lately which have puzzled
me. Is your sister fond of music?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think so.’</p>

<p>‘You only think so?’</p>

<p>‘I hardly know her, you know. She is
my half-sister. Once, when she was a mere
baby, I saw her; and not again till a month
ago—till I came here. Most likely I shall
see more of her now. My father has been

<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>

instructing me in my duties towards her, and
he is perfectly right. If he would but come
home and settle down at Wellfield all would
be well. It is not good for a girl to live in
hotels, with no woman about her whom she
really knows, except her maid.’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed. But your sister does not
look in the least spoiled by that life.’</p>

<p>‘Because she is so isolated. She never
goes amongst the people at these places; she
cannot, because my father himself does not.
But it is a dull life for her.’</p>

<p>‘How old is she, exactly?’</p>

<p>‘A little more than sixteen.’</p>

<p>‘You must know, though, that she is very
lovely now, and that sometime she will be
remarkably beautiful.’</p>

<p>‘Avice—will she? She is pale, and her
hair—yes, her hair is beautiful, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wellfield! your own sister, whom you
see daily, and you ask if her hair is beautiful!’</p>

<p>‘Well, it is the fact of her being my own
sister, I suppose, whom I see daily, that
makes me ask,’ said Jerome, calmly. ‘I am

<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>

not so—forgetful in all cases. But I was
going to say that, though I don’t in the least
know when I shall be free again, yet, when I
am free, I am going to Cologne, where I
have some musical friends. Cologne is not
far from Elberthal, and, if you will allow me,
Miss Ford’—he hesitated in a manner which
his hearer thought decidedly becoming to
him—‘I should like exceedingly to come
over and visit your atelier, if I may—if it is
not too great a favour that I ask.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no! If you care to see my poor
attempts at pictures, I shall be delighted to
show you them.’</p>

<p>‘I have heard great things of your “poor
attempt at pictures,” Miss Ford.’</p>

<p>‘Have you? Some partial friend——’</p>

<p>‘It was Professor Wilhelmi, your master,
I think.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Well, he is a very partial friend.
He has been goodness itself to me. I should
never have done anything without his help.
But when you see what he has praised, you
can judge for yourself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>‘I am no judge when the work is the work
of a friend,’ said Jerome, smiling.</p>

<p>‘To-morrow they expect at Trockenau a
most formidable person—Herr Rudolf Falkenberg.’</p>

<p>‘The Frankfort banker?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know whether he is a banker or
not, though I believe I have heard that he is.
The important thing to me is, that he is a
great judge of pictures; and that, as he is
rich, he can afford to buy them when they
please him: but I have heard as well that he
is very severe, and most difficult to please.’</p>

<p>‘Surely that does not trouble you!’</p>

<p>‘It would trouble me if Herr Falkenberg
were to see some of my pictures, and pronounce
them very bad.’</p>

<p>‘As if he would have the ill-breeding to
do so!’</p>

<p>Sara laughed.</p>

<p>‘I see, you would never make a critic,’ she
said; and just then, coming to the end of a
long walk, they found themselves suddenly
in the full blaze of light which illuminated

<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>

the linden-planted square where all the little
tables stand, at which people sup or dine, or
take coffee, wine, or ices. A score of heads
and twice as many eyes were quickly turned
upon the tall and certainly striking-looking
couple who thus advanced into the light.</p>

<p>‘Take my arm,’ murmured Wellfield; and
Sara, dazzled by the light in which they so
suddenly found themselves, and a little embarrassed
by the amount of attention bestowed
upon her and her companion by the well-bred
crowd, complied mechanically, and they
walked rather quickly through the square.</p>

<p>‘I think, if we turn this way, we shall
probably find the others,’ said Jerome, as they
disappeared into the comparative obscurity
under the shade of the Kurhaus.</p>

<p>‘Very likely,’ said Sara, and at that moment
Hans Lemde came breathlessly after them.</p>

<p>‘Ah, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">mein Fräulein</i>, we thought you were
lost!’ he said, addressing Sara, and studiously
avoiding even looking at her companion.
‘The countess is waiting to seek her carriage,
for the road to Trockenau is rough.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, show us the way to where she is,
please,’ said Sara, with a touch of impatience.</p>

<p>Hans von Lemde walked stiffly in advance,
trying rather feebly to look dignified. He
was not naturally majestic in demeanour, and
the circumstances deprived him of what little
scrap of dignity he might in ordinary moments
rejoice in. The effect of the procession was
that of a noble and his lady preceded by a
somewhat weak-minded retainer, new to his
duties and afraid of taking too much upon
himself.</p>

<p>The Countess of Trockenau was not in the
violent hurry which might have been expected
from Lemde’s representations. She had time
again to greet Jerome Wellfield, and to
say:</p>

<p>‘By-the-bye, Mr. Wellfield, I have a party
to-morrow. Will you come?’</p>

<p>‘A very large party?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">so ziemlich</i>—quite without ceremony.
The ladies come to coffee and remain; the
gentlemen later, to the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Abendbrod</i> and music.

<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>

And a little dancing for the young people, I
daresay, and wandering in the garden for
those who like it. I shall expect you.’</p>

<p>‘If my father is better, or rather if he
should be no worse, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">gnädige Frau</i>, I shall
have the utmost pleasure,’ he said, bowing,
while Sara stood a little apart and carefully
fastened her glove. The countess turned to
speak to some one else, and Wellfield, with a
half-smile, politely suggested to Sara that
perhaps he could button her glove.</p>

<p>‘There is your carriage, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">gnädige Frau</i>,
going slowly down the road,’ exclaimed young
Lemde, as if eager to end the scene.</p>

<p>‘Call it, then,’ said Frau von Trockenau,
in much the same tone as that lately used by
Miss Ford. It was a tone very generally
adopted towards ‘poor Lemde.’</p>

<p>Obediently he hurried forward and hailed
the coachman of the lady, who was still in
lively conversation with a friend.</p>

<p>‘The carriage is here, most gracious, by
the roadside, waiting!’ announced Hans, in a
voice growing gradually louder and more portentous;

<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>

and he repeated the information
impressively.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Aber, dieser Mensch!</i>’ murmured the
‘gracious lady,’ as Wellfield advanced, gave
her his arm, and led her across the avenue to
the roadside, where her carriage was waiting.</p>

<p>Lemde wished very much to offer his arm
to Sara, but, looking furtively at her, decided
with a sigh not to venture, and turned instead
to Emily Leigh, the other English girl, who
immediately put her hand within his arm, and
tripped after Frau von Trockenau with the
utmost cheerfulness. Sara followed, dignified
and solitary. It was Jerome Wellfield who
handed her into the carriage.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Also—bis Morgen!</i>’ said the countess, bowing,
and waving her hand as they drove away.
Wellfield and Hans Lemde were left alone.</p>

<p>‘Are you going to the party to-morrow?’
asked Wellfield.</p>

<p>‘I? certainly. I go to all Frau von
Trockenau’s parties.’</p>

<p>‘That shows your good taste,’ replied
Jerome, gravely, raising his hat and wishing

<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>

him good-evening; and then, after another
look after the carriage as it drove rapidly
away down the Nassau Road, he turned and
sauntered slowly along the road towards the
hotel of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vier Jahreszeiten</i>, where Mr.
Wellfield and his family were staying.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Count and Countess of Trockenau
were both young, rich, and
what their countrymen call <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">lebenslustig</i>,
a word for which we have no equivalent
shorter than a well-rounded sentence of
explanation.</p>

<p>Their estate was large, and as beautiful as
heart could desire. It stood sloping up a
rounded, richly-wooded hill in the neighbourhood
of K——au; and from its great terrace,
as well as from other less distinguished points
of vantage, there was a broad and beautiful
vista over the rich and many-coloured plain,
to where in a silver line the Rhine might be

<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>

seen winding his way towards Coblenz. Far
distant, like blue clouds on the horizon, lay the
soft outlines of the Rhine mountains; far over
hill and dale shone the delicious sunshine,
while the fair land spread her broad bosom, in
the rich maturity of the latter July, to his
fervent beams.</p>

<p>All the summer long, Frau von Trockenau
loved to have her friends around her, and
those friends were various. Coffee-parties
and picnics—or rather the German equivalents
of picnics in the shape of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes</i> and
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Landparteien</i>, suppers and dances, riding and
driving, and, when it was late enough, shooting
and <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">die Jagd</i>. An admirable cook, wines of a
character not to disgrace the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cuisine</i>, a hearty
welcome, and unlimited liberty to the guest to
follow the bent of his own wishes—these were
the attractions offered to their guests by the
count and countess, and they proved so strong
that Frau von Trockenau very rarely had an
invitation refused. People refused or put off
other visits in order to make one to Schloss
Trockenau, and persons who were not

<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>

spontaneously invited there schemed to get
invitations.</p>

<p>To the initiated reader the remark will be
almost superfluous that the practices at
Schloss Trockenau must have been characterised
by a certain unconventionality and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laisser faire</i> not always found in German
or any other country houses, whether belonging
to the nobility or to the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bürgerschaft</i>.
This was the case, and the guests of the
countess were by no means confined to
persons who were her equals in rank, many
of whom, she was wont to say, might be
excellent creatures, but were often old, and,
when they lived in the country, were wont to
be dull. And dulness was the bane of the
countess’s existence. In their hatred of it
she and her husband were sworn allies; they
were never known to oppose one another’s
schemes for killing time, though it often
happened that in their zeal in that cause they
would both have provided some entertainment
for the same time. When this occurred,
the rule was that each should give way in

<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>

turn, and this plan was found to answer
admirably, and to be productive of the
greatest harmony, conjugal and social.</p>

<p>On the evening after that meeting in the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kurgarten</i>, a large company, or <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gesellschaft</i>,
was assembled in the rooms, or wandering
about the gardens and terraces of the Schloss.
It was a mixed and motley society. There
were friends of the count, brother officers
who were staying in the house, or who had
come over from Coblenz for the occasion;
young men from Berlin, fashionable or otherwise;
some gay cousins of Countess Carla,
very stylish young ladies indeed, who, with
their pretty cousin as a chaperon, were
creating havoc by their accomplishments, and
by their airs and graces, in the hearts of all
the shy young <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Junker</i> in the vicinity, except
in that of Hans von Lemde, who was irresistibly
drawn in another direction. There
were some young Englishmen from Bonn,
fellow-students and friends of the count’s
younger brother. There were two learned
professors, and a poetess whose verses were

<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>

<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">fades</i>, and who was rightly and universally
voted a bore, but who was amongst the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">von</i>-est
of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">vons</i>, and who distinctly and unmistakably
belonged to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">genus irritabile</i>,
and apparently to no other.</p>

<p>There was Jerome Wellfield, who had just
arrived, and who was talking to his hostess;
there was Herr Rudolf Falkenberg, the
great banker and picture-critic, who had
arrived that morning. There was a knot of
stout, oddly-dressed, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gauche</i>-looking ladies of
a certain age, who clubbed together in a
corner, and represented the local nobility and
squirearchy.</p>

<p>‘No one knows who else may be coming,’
said one. ‘I think die Trockenau is much
too careless. She does not consider the
dignity of our position.’</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach, lieber Himmel!</i> Who is that?’
murmured another.</p>

<p>‘That’ was Sara Ford, who came sweeping
down the room with her head in the air,
followed by Herr Falkenberg, to whom she
talked in her frank, audible, unconstrained

<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>

English fashion, and who begged her to come
with him to the terrace that he might show
her a view which he said ought to be painted.</p>

<p>The pair were followed by the disapproving
looks of the local <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Junkerthum</i> before spoken
of, and by the round eyes of a number of
young German girls, just arrived at that
stage in life which is known to their countrymen
as the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Backfisch</i>. Now, a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Backfisch</i> is
a kind of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ingénue</i> not often met amongst
English girls; and Sara Ford could never,
by any chance, have had anything of the
genus about her. Consequently she was an
object of wonder, and some disapproval to
those who either were or had been <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Backfische</i>
themselves.</p>

<p>‘These English girls!’ sighed one of the
native nobility, shaking her head portentously.
‘If I were to see my Paula monopolise a man
in that way—but she is incapable of even
speaking to a gentleman before he speaks to
her. If a girl of mine were to be like that, I
should die.’</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gott</i>, yes!’ answered another, intently

<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>

watching, while Herr Falkenberg held open
the long glass-door, and Sara stepped through
it and down the steps on to the terrace. The
sun was setting as the young lady and the
banker paced towards the point to which he
wished to draw her attention. Sara was
dressed in black, and there was nothing
costly about her attire; for she was not rich,
and her only jewellery consisted in certain
old rings and a pearl-necklace, which had
long ago belonged to her mother when, as the
beautiful Marion Fanshawe, she had been
married to Sara’s father. Plain though the
dress was, it set her noble beauty off to great
advantage; and one felt—at least Herr Falkenberg
felt—the same conscientious delight in
looking at her grand, simple loveliness, as
results from the contemplation of some fine
carved gem of ancient days, found perhaps by
accident in the midst of a stock of gaudy
modern jewellery.</p>

<p>Sara had never met Herr Falkenberg
before. His name was well known to her
and to other artists as a judge of almost

<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>

unerring taste, and a patron of generous
liberality. He was the last of a line of
financiers and bankers of princely fortune
and passionate devotion to ‘the noble pastime
of art.’ She had felt highly flattered
when Frau von Trockenau brought him to
her, saying:</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Liebe</i> Sara, Herr Falkenberg wishes to
be introduced,’ after which he had remained
beside her chair, speaking of two of her pictures,
and discussing them with an admiration,
and at the same time a discrimination, which
instantly showed her that report had not
belied the keenness of his critical powers
and the purity of his taste in such matters.
‘Perhaps,’ thought Sara to herself, repressing
a smile of satisfaction, ‘if she were very
amiable, and listened with attention to his
criticisms, he might some day give her an
order; and if she could say to friends and
fellow-students, “I am painting this for Herr
Falkenberg,” it would be as good, indeed
much better, than fifty laudatory but unprofitable
criticisms.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>‘See!’ said he, as they came to the end of
the terrace—and he pointed to the round
shoulder of a hill, round the foot of which a
bend of the river flowed in a silver curve,
while the setting sun gave the most mellow
and warm tints to the stretch of the landscape
in the background—‘that is almost
perfect; there is a meaning in the scene—a
poetry. Do you not see it?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed I do!’ she replied; the deep look
settling in her eyes, which always visited
them when she looked upon grand or beautiful
things, and which alone would have made her
face a rare one. ‘I see it!’ she continued;
‘and I have studied and sketched it often since
I came here, and the result has been despair!
I hate myself, and every attempt I make.
I don’t think landscape is my forte.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t agree with you. I think you
ought to study landscape. I believe, from
the examination I have given to those two
little pictures of yours, that you might attain
high rank as a painter, both of landscape and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">genre</i>; with hard study, of course.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Herr Falkenberg, you are flattering!
It is impossible. I often think how presumptuous
it is in me to imagine that I shall
ever do well in either. Why should I?’</p>

<p>‘Why should you not?’ he asked, smiling.
‘You are ambitious.’</p>

<p>He had seated himself on the arm of a
bench at the end of the terrace, and Sara was
leaning upon the parapet, her arms folded on
the ledge of it; her glorious eyes gazing out
upon the feast of colour, of rich calm beauty
which lay below. As he uttered the last
words, the deep musing look left those eyes;
another fire flashed like lightning into them.
Her lips parted, the delicate nostril quivered.
She raised her head, and looked full at her
companion.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am. I am as ambitious as a man—the
worse for me, I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘I do not say so. How old are you?’</p>

<p>The question was put with a grave,
patronising directness which was free from the
faintest trace of curiosity or impertinence.
She answered it in the same spirit:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>‘I am twenty-three.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! it will be many years, no doubt,
before you do anything that will live. It is a
toilsome ascent to the high peaks and pure
snows of real lasting fame, but it may be accomplished
by a single-hearted perseverance.’</p>

<p>He paused, looking at her. The girl felt
herself strangely moved, half depressed at the
calmness with which he adjudged to her years
upon years of future toil, as if from that
verdict there could be no appeal, half with a
proud elation at the fact that so great a judge
should hold it possible that she could ever do
anything which would live. His eyes still
dwelt upon her face, and hers upon his. He
had a good, powerful, and attractive face;
dark, massively cut, with keen, shrewd, sarcastic
eyes under level dark eyebrows. The
small moustache and short pointed brown
beard gave great character to this visage, and
were two or three shades lighter than the
short-cropped hair. He was a man whose age
it would be difficult to guess. Sara imagined
him to be about forty; he might have been

<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>

any age from thirty to five-and-forty. She
had spoken to him, and listened to him entirely
as a well-known judge and possible
future patron of great power and influence—so
she regarded him still. Of what he was or
did, how he was regarded outside this, to her,
most important capacity, she had not the least
idea, and formed none to herself.</p>

<p>‘You have a sketch of that bit,’ he said at
last; ‘would you mind letting me see it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! well, if you will promise to regard it
merely as a rough attempt, done more because
my instinct compelled me to try to reproduce
that scene—not as anything that was ever intended
for anyone to see but myself,’ said
Sara, very unwilling to submit so crude an
attempt to such critical eyes, and yet not
wishing to appear affected.</p>

<p>‘If you showed it me, I should judge it
entirely on its own merits, of course,’ was the
composed reply, and Sara felt suddenly, as
many other persons often felt in exchanging
ideas with Herr Falkenberg, that with him
simplicity of nature and conduct reigned

<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>

supreme, and that to make excuses and apologies
to him was so much trouble lost. Sara
wished she had not made that little speech
about her sketch, and Falkenberg went on:</p>

<p>‘I am staying here a few days, so perhaps
to-morrow, before we set off to Lahnburg——’</p>

<p>‘Are we going to Lahnburg?’</p>

<p>‘I believe so; the countess is, at any rate.
I have a little country house there, which she
was so kind as to say she very much wished
to see, and I asked her if she would not make
a party and go there with me to-morrow.
She said she wanted you to go too, but I
don’t suppose she will force you there against
your will,’ he added, smiling.</p>

<p>‘It would be anything but against my will.
It is a place I have often wished to see.’</p>

<p>‘Then I am glad you are going. There
may be time for you to give me your sketch
to-morrow morning, early, if you will be so
kind; and, as I expect to be in Elberthal
during the autumn, may I call at your
atelier?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>‘I shall be honoured if you do,’ said Sara,
her cheeks flushing with pleasure at this
mark of favour. ‘I only fear that you will
leave the said atelier a sadder and a wiser
man.’</p>

<p>‘As how?’</p>

<p>‘As having discovered my attempts to be
very poor, commonplace delusions after all.’</p>

<p>‘That remains to be seen; all I hope is
that you will not be offended if one who, by
some misfortune, has got such an inveterate
habit of pointing out what appear to him the
merits and demerits of any composition,
should——’</p>

<p>‘That would be of the utmost advantage
to me,’ said she, gaily, wondering how long
the interview was to last, and wondering also,
in strict privacy, whether critics—of that eminence—never
relaxed into a laugh; whether
a sedate smile were all their lips would condescend
to.</p>

<p>How long the interview might have lasted
it is impossible to say. At that moment it
was interrupted. Frau von Trockenau, with

<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>

a number of the ingenuous girls before
alluded to—whose tender years and inexperience
she seemed to find somewhat embarrassing
during the ‘off season,’ before the
dancing began—Emily Leigh, Jerome Wellfield,
Hans Lemde, and others, came up.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Herr Falkenberg!’ cried the
countess, seeing him, ‘a word with you.’</p>

<p>She paused, as did also Jerome Wellfield,
and the others went on. Wellfield had not
yet spoken to Sara, and while Frau von
Trockenau discoursed with much animation
to Falkenberg on some point connected with
the morrow’s excursion, Jerome turned to
Miss Ford.</p>

<p>The flush of exultation which her conversation
with Falkenberg had aroused, died
from her cheeks. She silently put her hand
into that of Wellfield, while he, an expression
of pleasure dawning in his face, asked her
how she did.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the countess put her
hand within Falkenberg’s arm, and they
went up the terrace, in earnest conversation.

<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>

Jerome and Sara were left standing
alone.</p>

<p>‘Herr Falkenberg is a friend of yours?’
asked Wellfield.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I hope he will be. He
would be a very valuable friend to me.’</p>

<p>‘I can suppose so. Does he wish you to
paint this scene?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. And it is very beautiful. Do you
not think so?’</p>

<p>‘It is—lovely. I wish you could see the
place my father will not live at—Wellfield
Abbey and the country round about. As an
artist, you would delight in it.’</p>

<p>‘But it is in Lancashire, isn’t it?’ asked
Sara.</p>

<p>‘Yes. What then?’ inquired he.</p>

<p>‘I always fancy it such a black, hideous
place. I have only once been in Lancashire,
when I passed through Preston with my
father on our way to Scotland, years ago.’</p>

<p>‘Then you passed not a hundred miles from
Wellfield,’ he rejoined with some animation.
‘But I own, you could not be favourably

<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>

impressed with what you saw there. It is not
lovely. But Wellfield is.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I may see it some day—who
knows?’ said Sara, musingly.</p>

<p>‘I am sure I hope you may,’ he answered
quickly. ‘There is nothing I should so
much——’</p>

<p>He paused abruptly. Sara felt her face
flush, and said quickly:</p>

<p>‘Would not you like to come down this
side-walk—this ilex walk? The countess has
spent a great deal of care and attention upon
it, in remembrance of the ilexes of Rome.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, the ilexes at Rome! I remember
them,’ he said, as he followed her into the
cool green gloom of the ilex walk, where
daylight was dimmed by the intertwining
boughs which formed a roof above.</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour later they returned
to the same spot, and found that it
was almost dark. The windows of the
Schloss blazed with lights, and the music
which streamed out on the air said that the
dancing had begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>‘What a long time we must have been
out!’ said Sara, in a dreamy voice. ‘They
are dancing.’</p>

<p>‘So they are. Will you give me this
waltz?—it is a waltz, I hear.’</p>

<p>‘With pleasure,’ said Sara, as they walked
towards the house. ‘There is to be a cotillon,’
she added; ‘it is the great thing at
these German dances, and Frau von
Trockenau has made elaborate arrangements
for it.’</p>

<p>‘What a pity I don’t know how to do it!’</p>

<p>‘You should learn,’ said Sara.</p>

<p>‘There is nothing I should like better if
you are at liberty to——’ began Jerome, as
they entered the room by the long glass-door,
just within which stood Lemde, not dancing.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mein Fräulein</i>,’ said the poor youth,
humbly coming forward, ‘will you honour me
by dancing the cotillon with me?’</p>

<p>‘How fortunate for me that I secured your
promise a moment ago,’ said Jerome, with
imperturbable composure and a slight
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>Hans’s face fell; that of Sara crimsoned as
she said:</p>

<p>‘I am very sorry, Baron Lemde, but I have
promised it to Mr. Wellfield.’</p>

<p>In another moment she was waltzing with
Jerome Wellfield, and Junker Hans, after
watching them for a few moments, turned
aside.</p>

<p>‘She is too proud and too clever, I
suppose, to have anything to do with me,’
he was saying to himself, as he struggled
with a degrading and childish inclination to
cry. ‘And those other fellows, Falkenberg,
and that Wellfield, and the others, I’ve no
chance against them. It’s odd,’ the youth
continued moodily to reflect, ‘how little a lot
of these English girls care for rank. Falkenberg
is <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">bürgerlich</i>: Wellfield—it isn’t his
rank she cares for; it’s his way, I suppose,
of behaving as if he had a right to everything
he sees—they don’t mind rank when a
man has “go,” or when he pleases them;
but then they are so hard to please.’</p>

<p>To Sara, the evening passed like a dream.

<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>

This was the first, the very first and most
delicate flavour and aroma of love, which
with her could only be deep and earnest, full
and profound, as her own nature. She knew
that she was beautiful, without having ever
thought much about it. She had seen
admiration in men’s eyes before now; she
had heard words of love and beseeching
addressed to her once or twice, and all had
lightly passed over her spirit, like a breath of
air across a fair garden. But Wellfield’s
eyes, with their eloquent homage, thrilled her;
his mere presence aroused in her the feeling,
never known before, of delight, mingled with
apprehension; she shrank away from trying
to guess, even in her own mind, how much
his look meant—what the end of this episode
would be. She questioned and doubted, for
the first time, her own powers of pleasing,
because for the first time she was desirous
above all things to please. Advanced spirits
may condemn such anxiety as servile and
degrading. No opinion is offered upon
those points, only the certainty expressed

<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>

that such feelings of ‘servility’ are very
common amongst women, and men too, who
are in love. Instead of feeling confidence
now, she absolutely trembled lest she should
have mistaken the meaning of his glance,
and of the few words he had now and then
dropped, and which had seemed to her to
have a deeper meaning than mere phrases of
politeness or of compliment.</p>

<p>Such was her deprecatory and tremblingly
uncertain state of mind—hers, who had
laughed through life, free from tyrant love
or care, undaunted by reverses, and holding
her own against difficulties with a steadfastness
born of innate, inbred courage of soul.
Till now every higher thought and aspiration
had been resolutely and singly directed
towards her art, and her own advancement
in it. Her heart’s desire had been faithfully,
so far as she could, to act up to Goethe’s
words, and—</p>

   <div class="blockquot">
     <div class="verse first-line">‘Im Ganzen, Guten, Wahren</div>
     <div class="verse">Resolut zu leben.’</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The defeat had been rapid and complete,

<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>

and, true to her woman’s nature, she rejoiced
in it rather than otherwise. At least, this
night, in Jerome’s presence, and surrounded
by the subtle incense of admiration and
flattery which he offered her, she rejoiced in
it. There were other times, when he was
absent, in which the rejoicing was not pure,
and the sense of captivity was stronger than
the thrill of love.</p>

<p>The evening thus passed on, and every
time she met those dark and eloquent eyes
she felt, with a throb of the heart, the
half-welcome, half-dreaded conviction grow
stronger—‘This that I see in his eyes is
love!’</p>

<p>There ensued a pause in the dancing,
organised by Frau von Trockenau, in order
to have some music; for she was a woman
who utilised all her resources, and never
allowed the meanest tool to rust for want of
use; and knowing that there were several
admirable musicians, vocal and instrumental,
in the company, she was firmly resolved that
they should display their talents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>A certain young Englishwoman, married
to one Count Eugen of Rothenfels, was the
first to sing. The fair soprano was filling
the room with a flood of melody, when the
countess came up to the place where Sara
Ford was seated, somewhat apart, with
Jerome Wellfield leaning over the back of
her chair, his eyes dreamily fixed on the face
of the singer.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wellfield,’ said his pretty little
hostess, ‘I know I am asking a very great
favour, and that you hate it; but <em>won’t</em> you
sing to-night, to please me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, will you?’ said Sara, involuntarily.
She had heard wonderful rumours of Wellfield’s
voice, and the wish to hear him was
strong.</p>

<p>He bowed towards the countess.</p>

<p>‘To please you, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">gnädige Frau</i>,’ he said,
with a slight smile, ‘is a privilege, and I
shall at once obey your order when I
receive it.’</p>

<p>‘That is good! <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">recht freundlich!</i>’ exclaimed
the lady, radiant with delight; for

<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>

Wellfield’s reserve was generally as great as
his talent was said to be, and she had had
little hope of his consenting to sing before
that large audience of perfect strangers. She
confided her success to the ear of one of her
cousins, Helene von Lehnberg, who said,
with a sneer:</p>

<p>‘Another of your English amateurs, Carla?
For my part, I don’t think much of a talent
that is so haughty and reserved as almost to
require one to go on one’s knees to it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my dear Helene! I doat upon proud,
haughty people, when they are just the
reverse to me, which is the case with Mr.
Wellfield,’ rejoined Frau von Trockenau, not
without malice.</p>

<p>‘I am glad you are going to sing,’ said
Sara to Jerome, when they were alone again.</p>

<p>‘I am naturally of an obliging disposition,
and could not refuse the Frau Gräfin.’</p>

<p>‘She is delighted,’ said Sara, with a smile.</p>

<p>‘When I have done,’ said Wellfield, in a
low tone, ‘I shall come and ask if you were
delighted—may I?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>‘May you?’ she stammered.</p>

<p>‘I mean, will you answer me if I do come?’</p>

<p>‘Do you expect me to tell you that I am
not delighted?’</p>

<p>‘I expect nothing, therefore I am blessed;
but I desire very much that you should tell
me the truth.’</p>

<p>‘I will do so if you wish it.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you.... Yes, Frau Gräfin, I see
and I obey,’ he added, as the countess was
perceived making her way to him.</p>

<p>There was some little stir and sensation
when Wellfield advanced to the piano. ‘An
Englishman, an amateur—<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">nun, wir werden
’mal sehen!</i>’ said one or two sceptics, with a
supercilious curl of the lip.</p>

<p>‘What does he sing? English songs—“The
Last Rose of Summer”?’ asked one young
lady, sarcastically.</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ whispered a dapper little lieutenant,
who was paying her devoted attention;
‘he will sing a comic song, “What Jolly Dogs
we are!” An Englishman told me last week
that they sang nothing else in England now.

<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>

He was at a party where nineteen of the
company had brought their music——’</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gott!</i> Herr Lieutenant, how horrible!’
tittered the young lady.</p>

<p>‘And sixteen out of the nineteen had
brought “What Jolly Dogs we are!” Fact, I
assure you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parole d’honneur</i>! But hush!
He is playing his own accompaniment.
What! Rubinstein! “Asra!” Impossible!’</p>

<p>If so, the impossible was being performed
in a masterly manner. Would-be sarcastic
lieutenants, tittering young ladies, were
bewitched into silence and admiration.
Rubinstein’s weird and melodious legend
of the youth whose race ‘die if they love,’
was sung to the end, as few of the audience
had ever before heard it sung. The last
notes, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die sterben wenn sie lieben</i>, were
followed at first by silence; and then some
murmurs, not loud, but deep, of applause,
greeted the singer.</p>

<p>The song that followed was, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Es blinkt der
Thau</i>, and it made Sara’s heart beat. That
finished, as if to give his audience a complete

<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>

change, he struck a couple of deep chords,
and began to sing that oft-quoted, hackneyed,
but ever-beautiful <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ich grolle nicht</i>.</p>

<p>Sara felt a slight shiver run through her.
Why did he choose that one weird song of
Heine’s, set to Schumann’s equally weird
music? She had heard it once at a concert,
sung in a style which hardly rose above
mediocrity, and yet even then it had
impressed her; and she had pondered
involuntarily over the gruesome, hinted
mystery of the last lines. Jerome sang the
strange song with a depth and a meaning
all his own: her artist-nature thrilled to the
strains, which are in very truth a song of
death; it was ghostly—it was as if her spirit
was enfeebled and chilled, and had to trail
its drooping wings through a land full of
vague and awful shadows.</p>

<div class="poetry-container40">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>There was a pause as he finished this song.
Jerome half-rose from the piano, but a voice
cried from the window:</p>

<p>‘We have not had the test yet, Mr.
Wellfield. Give us a love-song. Give us
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Adeläida</i>.’</p>

<p>Sara saw, even from her place in the background,
the expression that flashed into the
young man’s eyes, and over his face.</p>

<p>‘Good!’ was all he said, as he sat down
again, and that melodious, significant single
<em>F</em> was struck—that note which is the prelude
to the sea of love and fire and passion
which follows.</p>

<p>Sara sat pale and composed in her place,
but feeling as if everyone in the room must
see and observe that she was blushing
furiously—so burningly hot were her cheeks.
Each time that the notes ‘Adeläida’ rang
out, she felt that she was apostrophised—the
company, and the lighted room oppressed
her—yet she looked, to one who was
observing her from the other side of the
room, grave, quiet, almost tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>When the last notes had died away,
Wellfield rose very decidedly, nor could he
be prevailed upon to sing another note. The
company clustered round him, thanked him,
and congratulated him; asked to be introduced
to him, and dispersed. Dancing began
again, and still Sara sat as if spell-bound, in
the place where he had left her.</p>

<p>‘I have come to know if you approved?’
murmured Jerome’s voice beside her.</p>

<p>She looked up, and met his eyes with
an expression in them, before which her
own in vain tried to remain calm and untroubled.</p>

<p>‘If I approved?’ she said, indistinctly.
‘How can you ask?’</p>

<p>Jerome was leaning against the wall, looking
down at her—looking, too, as undisturbed as
if he had been asking her whether she would
have an ice. In the same manner, with the
same tone, so low that none but she could
hear it, he added:</p>

<p>‘And did you understand?’</p>

<p>‘I—I think so,’ said Sara, faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>‘Herr Wellfield, Miss Ford! the cotillon
is about to begin. Here is your favour, Mr.
Wellfield. Be good enough to let me pin it
on, and then go and find your partner.’</p>

<p>It was Fräulein von Lehnberg, one of the
countess’s Berlin cousins, who spoke, with
some impatience in her voice; for she had
twice addressed Jerome, and he had taken no
notice of her. He stepped forward now, and
held the basket of ribbons while she pinned
on his favour, with an imperturbable severity
of gravity which irritated the young lady
exceedingly. Then he offered Sara his arm,
and they advanced to meet the rest of the
company.</p>

<p>In the discussions next day on the subject,
it was universally decided that Mr. Wellfield
might be a musical, Miss Ford an artistic
prodigy; but that in the matter of dancing a
cotillon they both displayed to the full that
insular stiffness characteristic of their nation.
That little Emily Leigh had ten times the
spirit of her taller and handsomer country-woman.
How gracefully she danced, and

<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>

contrived to make even that maypole, Hans
Lemde, look almost graceful too.</p>

<p>Beloved and candid discussions of the day
after! How much does not society and the
individual owe to you, in the matter of
establishment of the facts, and an exhaustive
analysis of the motives actuating the behaviour
of those who come before your
tribunal! May nothing ever occur to make
you less vigorous or less rigorous than you
are at this day!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the following morning, Sara came
into the room where Falkenberg
was standing alone, waiting for the
rest of the company who were going to
Lahnburg. In her hand she carried a small
canvas.</p>

<p>‘Here, Herr Falkenberg, is the sketch
you wished to see. I remembered it, and
brought it downstairs with me.’</p>

<p>Falkenberg thanked her, took the sketch,
and looked at it in silence, until Sara said:</p>

<p>‘It is as I expected. You are racking
your brains to find out how to say “Atrocious”
so that it shall sound like something else.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>‘If I had to say  “Atrocious,”  I’m afraid I
should say it, much though I might dislike
having to do so,’ he answered, smiling. ‘As
it is, I wish to say nothing of the kind.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a relief!’</p>

<p>‘There are the carriages coming round,’
he added composedly, ‘to take us to the Ems
railway station. May I take the sketch to
my own room? There is no time to look at
it now.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, if you care to do so.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said he, taking it up, and
leaving the room with it.</p>

<p>Sara sat down at the piano, and played
tunes, until at last Frau von Trockenau came
whirling into the room with a pair of long
gloves in her hand.</p>

<p>‘Are you ready, Sara? Yes—of course.
How horrid of you! You never keep the
company waiting. What a rush it is, this
life! Oh, how I long to be alone sometimes!’</p>

<p>‘Complimentary to us and to poor Count
Trockenau!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>The countess laughed heartily.</p>

<p>‘My poor Fritz!—of course I spoke exceptionally.’</p>

<p>‘You know you would hate to be alone,’
added Sara. ‘You cannot live out of a rush.
I wonder what you would do if you had to
lead my life at Elberthal.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but you have a great soul. Mine is
such a very little one. Little in every way.
It is so small that it has led me to—what do
you think?’</p>

<p>‘I am sure I cannot say. To tell Hans
Lemde that I am dying to paint his portrait,
I dare say.’</p>

<p>‘No! But oh, what a lovely idea! I will
tell him so, and I will say that you said it.
Poor Hans! I imagine him sitting to you.
Oh, I think I see his face!’</p>

<p>They both laughed in a manner which
Baron Lemde would probably think malignant,
and Frau von Trockenau went on.</p>

<p>‘No, but I was so annoyed at the way in
which Helene and Maria Lehnberg behaved
last evening—giving themselves such airs,

<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>

that I have done something spiteful to them
to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Shameful! But what is it?’</p>

<p>‘I have doomed them to drive with me
and Lemde in the barouche; Fritz rides, and
I am sending you first in the pony-phaeton
with Herr Falkenberg.’</p>

<p>‘I see nothing so very spiteful in that.
Why should your cousins object?’</p>

<p>‘My dear Sara! I believe you live in
a dream. Don’t you know that Helene
Lehnberg would give her right hand if
Falk——Oh, here he is. Good-morning,
Herr Falkenberg. I shall not be a moment.
How beautifully you are dressed, Sara!
Beside you, I feel like a collection of tags
of coloured ribbon. You are both ready.
Well, shall we go? Herr Falkenberg, I am
going to ask you to drive Miss Ford to the
station in the pony-phaeton. Herr von
Lemde will go with my cousins and me.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be delighted,’ observed Herr
Falkenberg; and Sara followed the countess
out of the room, lost in wonder as to what she

<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>

meant by saying that she had done something
spiteful to her cousins, and what it was Helene
Lehnberg would give her right hand for.</p>

<p>Very soon she was seated beside Falkenberg,
and they were driving down the hill,
along the Nassau Road to Ems, which was
reached before long; past the hotel of the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vier Jahreszeiten</i>, to the station.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is a wayside railway station on a
German line, which station, twenty years ago,
was a thing of the future, and which I will
here call Lahnburg. It is the scene of the
<cite>Leiden des jungen Werther</cite>—it is the place
where Goethe adored, and where the object
of his adoration placidly ‘went on cutting
bread and butter.’ It was then Goethe’s,
Lotte’s, Jerusalem’s home; now it is an out-of-the-way
country town which is completely
out of the beaten route of the tourist, and
which few persons have heard of, and fewer
still care to visit.</p>

<p>Leave the train—it is a slow one—all the
trains are slow which deign to stop at Lahnburg.

<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>

At Lahnburg they hurry no one—themselves
least of all. Now we are on the
asphalted platform of the little station, in the
presence of a Prussian, with a blue coat and
a fierce moustache, who sternly demands
our <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gepäckschein</i>. If we have luggage, we
meekly give it him, thankful to be so well, if
so severely taken care of. If we have none,
we mention the fact, and leave him to wonder
what sinister motives could have brought us
to that spot, and to look at us as if he would
place us under arrest, were not his powers so
shamefully limited. We leave the station,
and take the road leading towards the town.</p>

<p>Along an uninteresting country-road, till
we begin to drive up the hill around and
upon which the town is built. Up the steep,
rugged streets, between the high antique
houses, slowly and joltingly lumbering over
the stones, in and out, and round about up
the hill, till we arrive at the Marktplatz, and
behold, surrounding the great cobble-stoned
square, all the principal buildings of the town!
Pause, Jehu! thou reckless charioteer—pause,

<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>

that we may fully take into our minds the
scene about us. Here we are, in the middle
of the square. There, opposite to us, stands
the solemn old <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>, built of a warmly-hued,
reddish stone. From its midst rises the
nucleus of it all—that which is older than
Christianity, the seamed, cracked, scarred,
black, old <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Heidenthurm</i>—the ‘heathen-tower,’
remnant of long-past Roman rule. Blasted,
black and ruined, but grim and defiant,
majestic and undegraded still, in the midst
of its wreck, it fronts us, and towers over the
town and landscape beneath; for the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i> is
built on the very summit of the hill; and
before it was, was the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Heidenthurm</i>. It
watches over the fertile hill-slopes and over
the level, poplar-fringed meads at the foot
of them, between which the gliding Lahn
holds its course. Since that grim old sentinel
first took his stand there, what changes have
not taken place! The very face of the landscape
has altered, while dynasties changed
and kings and people rose and fell, and
kingdoms and empires flourished and passed

<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>

away. Varied have been the signs of the
heavens above him—more varied far the life-stories,
the joys, the sorrows, the raptures,
and the agonies of the races which have
grown up, have lived and died, married and
brought children into the world—while he
stood there defiant and unchangeably grim.</p>

<p>There on the right hand of the square is a
more modern safety-guard, and one more in
consonance with the advanced civilisation
which has arisen since the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Heidenthurm</i> was
built. This latter guardian is the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wachtstube</i>,
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wache</i>, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hauptwache</i>, as it is indiscriminately
called—the guardhouse, peopled with half a
dozen scrubby-looking soldiers, and a couple
of lieutenants, with a white mongrel cur, alternately
their plaything and their victim during
the weary hours of ennui. The <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Heidenthurm</i>
turns its back upon this outcome of a high
civilisation and the Christian religion—what
has it in common with the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wachtstube</i>, or the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wachtstube</i> with it? To the left, more
houses: that big clumsy building with the
Prussian eagle over the doorway is the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Rathhaus</i>;

<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>

therein the Herr Bürgermeister and his
belongings live and move and have their
being. Filling in the gaps more and more
houses, each one a picture, each roof a distracting
medley of hills and dales, ups and
downs, dormer windows, turrets, chimney-stacks
whose irregularity would break the
heart of a high-minded architect of modern
suburban villas. And here too, last but not
least, for those who want accommodation, with
mine host bowing and smiling before the door,
is that lumbering old structure, the inn of the
place—the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gasthof zum Herzoglichen Hause</i>,
a building bearing some inexplicable, indefinable,
but most indubitable resemblance to
Noah’s ark, as pictured to the popular imagination
in the toyshop windows.</p>

<p>Our party had proceeded thus far—that is,
to the market square—on their way from the
station. The countess and one of her cousins
only had taken seats in the carriage which
had met them. The men, Sara Ford, and the
other Fräulein von Lehnberg had walked.
The German ladies went into raptures over

<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>

the place; it was <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">reizend</i>, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">entzückend</i>, and
many other superlative expressions of admiration.
Sara asked Falkenberg aside:</p>

<p>‘Is it impossible to go into the old <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>
and explore Lotte Buff’s house, and these
other quaint old places?’</p>

<p>‘It is, on the contrary, very possible, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">mein
Fräulein</i>. But,’ he added in a lower tone,
‘would you care to go with all these people?’</p>

<p>Sara shrugged her shoulders, smiling a
little.</p>

<p>‘I see you would not. I will arrange that
you have a good view of whatever you wish
to see. Meantime, suppose we go on to my
house, where lunch will be ready for us, I
expect.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder,’ thought Sara within herself,
‘whether his wife and family are away from
home, or whether his wife is just a slave and
a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hausfrau</i>, as so many of them appear to
be.’</p>

<p>The carriage was now driven past the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hauptwache</i>, up a street leading out of a
corner of the square, on to a breezy upland

<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>

road, from which there was a fine view over
the level fields far below to the left, while
on the right there were pleasant-looking fir-clad
hills, over which a bracing breeze blew.</p>

<p>Herr Falkenberg’s ‘summer-house’ was
situated not very far up the said road; it was
an old grey grange, standing on a slope at the
right hand, surrounded on three sides by what
had been a moat, and it was over the remains
of a drawbridge that the carriage drove into
the grounds. Sara lingered a moment before
the grey moss-grown stone archway, trying to
make out a half-defaced inscription above it.
Herr Falkenberg lingered too, and said:</p>

<p>‘You cannot read that, Miss Ford. I
own that it was one of the great attractions
of the place to me when I bought it.’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ she asked. ‘I cannot see.’</p>

<p>‘First there are the initials of the builder,
R. K., which stand, I believe, for Rodolf
Kammermann; and then, beneath the date,
1560; and on either side, still easily to be
read, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mein Genügen</i>. I thought it was a
good omen for happiness.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed. And is that the name of
the place?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. It is called to this day <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mein Genügen</i>.’
<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>‘I like it,’ said Sara, musingly. ‘That old
baron, or whatever he was, must have had
poetry in his soul.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; poetry which he succeeded in
expressing simply and beautifully, in this old
house with the lovely view,’ said Falkenberg,
as they followed the others, overtaking them
at the door.</p>

<p>From the door-steps there certainly was a
very fair prospect—an uninterrupted view to
the river in the vale below, and to the hills
on the opposite side of it. To the left could
just be seen some of the roofs of the town,
showing that <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mein Genügen</i> was not utterly
alone in the world, and the higher red
turrets of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>, and the ragged top of
the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Heidenthurm</i>.</p>

<p>‘Not the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wachtstube</i>, fortunately,’ remarked
Sara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>‘Luckily not,’ rejoined Falkenberg.</p>

<p>More bursts of delight from the ladies—rushes
into the house, into the garden, everywhere.
A courteous invitation from the host
to enter, and lay aside their outdoor things
and rest, until lunch should be ready. Which
invitation was complied with. An entrance
into the house, and more admiration, for the
salon was a quaint and charming room, full
of quaint, charming, and costly things.</p>

<p>‘He must be alone, I suppose,’ Sara
decided within herself, as no lady came forward,
and Herr Falkenberg continued himself
to do the honours with an ease of manner
and an apparent simplicity which exquisitely
concealed the perfect tact he employed.</p>

<p>He contrived—for he had that special gift
so rarely found—to make each separate
person there to feel him or herself to be ‘the
honoured guest’ <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>; and he
succeeded at least in delighting two of his
visitors, Frau von Trockenau and Sara Ford.
The two Fräulein von Lehnberg were rather
more difficult. They were annoyed that

<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>

there was only Hans von Lemde to be
monopolised.</p>

<p>They stood in the window, talking with
him and Graf von Trockenau, who was
trying to recall the particulars of some place
in the neighbourhood ‘which everyone
ought to see,’ and in this endeavour he was
feebly and ineffectually seconded by Hans
von Lemde, whose profound studies in such
literature as the <cite>Almanach de Gotha</cite> had
apparently disqualified him for more commonplace
topics. Sara had seated herself beside
a curious old painted spinet which stood at one
side of the room. Frau von Trockenau was
beside her, and Falkenberg was leaning on the
aforesaid spinet talking to them, or rather
listening while the countess talked to him.</p>

<p>‘It is a paradise of a place, Herr Falkenberg.
There is nothing I should like better
than to have such a place—only a week of it
would be enough for me, because it is too
small to have a large party in. It would be
dull beyond expression after seven days, and
you see my husband is not a financier—the

<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>

very reverse, poor fellow!—so he could not
afford to indulge me with such a toy for one
week in the year.’</p>

<p>‘I spend a good deal more than one week
in the year here, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">gnädige Frau</i>——’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes; but you have a great soul, like
Miss Ford. I was telling her so this
morning. You can exist without company
and distractions.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps Herr Falkenberg does not care
for visitors,’ suggested Sara, utterly unconscious
of committing any solecism. ‘Perhaps
the society of his wife and family is sufficient
for him.’</p>

<p>‘Sara!’ ejaculated the countess; and then,
as if much entertained, the pretty little lady
tried to stifle a laugh which would not be
altogether repressed. Into Falkenberg’s
eyes leaped a strange, disappointed expression;
and at that moment they met those of
Sara, who was looking up at him, surprised at
his manner and at that of her friend. The
man’s colour rose, and he laughed too, a little
unsteadily, as he replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>‘I am not so fortunate as Miss Ford
imagines. I have neither wife nor child.’</p>

<p>‘No wife!’ echoed Sara, in astonishment;
and then, laughing too, but with a heightened
colour, she said:</p>

<p>‘I am sure I beg your pardon. I don’t
know what made me take it for granted that
you were married. No one ever told me so.
It was stupid of me.’</p>

<p>‘I do not see why you should think so,’
he answered, trying to laugh in his turn; but
there was a tinge of constraint in the laugh,
and by some means his eyes met those of
the Countess of Trockenau. She appeared
to be laughing still, a little; her handkerchief
before her mouth, but it was not all a
laugh in the glance that met his. Countess
Carla had indeed a most active brain, if one
somewhat lacking in consequence, and failing
in the matter of logic. The thought which
then darted through her mind was, ‘Falkenberg
is much struck with Sara Ford.  He
does not like to find that she has all along
thought he was married and done for; and

<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>

that, therefore, she can never have bestowed
one tender thought upon him. And it is a
shame, too. I believe they are made for one
another, and I do like him so much. Why
should it not be? I like the idea.’</p>

<p>She ceased to laugh entirely. She rose,
placed her arm within his, and asked him to
tell her about a picture at the opposite side
of the room.</p>

<p>They walked away. Sara was left, with
her elbow resting on the top of the painted
spinet, thinking:</p>

<p>‘Not married? how odd! But why should
I have supposed he was? I suppose that was
what Carla meant, when she said she had been
spiteful to the Lehnbergs—she said Helene
Lehnberg would give her right hand—oh,
that was too bad! He is immensely rich, if
not noble. Yes, I see it all now ... and
certainly he is far too good for that vain,
boastful coquette.’</p>

<p>When lunch was announced they went into
the dining-room, and the repast was in no
way calculated to throw discredit on the management

<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>

of the occasional summer residence
of a rich Frankfort banker, or upon the presence
of mind and mental powers of his
housekeeper. Sara found herself seated at
one side of her host, while Countess Carla
was opposite; while Fräulein von Lehnberg,
drawing her black brows together, wondered
on what known or unknown principle of
etiquette that Englishwoman was given a
higher place than herself. But Herr Falkenberg
was most distinctly not only host but
master in his own house, and when he had
placed a chair for Helene and asked her to
take a certain place, she had perforce consented.
Sara did not bestow much attention
upon the order of precedence; but her interest
had been roused in her host, and she saw from
a certain beaming look on Countess Carla’s
face that she was thoroughly well-pleased with
everything, and with herself in particular. In
consequence of this, she seconded all Falkenberg’s
efforts at conversation, and the meal
was passing off brightly enough. Sara observed
her host more closely, and the more

<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>

she observed him the better she liked him.
By the time that lunch was half over, she had
forgotten that he was a great critic, who had
got a sketch of hers upon which he was going
to pass judgment: this point disappeared in
her growing appreciation of his qualities as a
man and a companion. His perfect modesty
in the midst of his wealth and great surroundings
struck her more than anything else.
Sara loved to see power in man or woman;
but assumption she hated with a hatred that
was almost ludicrous.</p>

<p>Just at this time the door opened, and
a fresh-looking young gentleman entered,
started on seeing so many guests, and was
about to back out again; but Falkenberg
sprang up, saying:</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Willkommen!</i> you thought I was alone, I
expect. Come in and join us.’</p>

<p>With which he introduced him as Baron
Arthur Eckberg, to the two Berlin ladies in
particular. He was awarded a seat between
them. Helene’s black brows relaxed in their
frown. Presently her voice was heard in

<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>

dulcet tones. She was appeased; and the
countess became more radiant than ever.</p>

<p>When the party again repaired to the
salon, a rather confused conversation ensued.
It was found that three hours remained to be
disposed of, before it would be time to return
to the railway station. Herr Falkenberg,
with a courteous patience which was beautiful
to behold, tried to find out what his lady-guests,
to use an ancient phrase, ‘would be
at.’ This was rather a difficult task, as the
Lehnberg sisters displayed emphatically ‘a
diversity of gifts, but the same spirit,’—the
gifts, namely, of caprice, contrariety, and perverseness,
and the same spirit of cool self-seeking
and resolution that all should give
way to them. Some one appealed to Sara.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said she, holding up a little
sketching-board, ‘the present professional
opportunity is too good to be missed. I am
going to sketch the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>, if my going out
alone will not be thought rude. I can find
my way to the Market Square, and I will
come back here in plenty of time, so I beg

<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>

that no one will be in any trouble about
me.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t go far away from here, as I may
join you later, <em>when</em> the others have made up
their minds,’ said the countess, in the blandest
of voices.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Sara, smiling, and, with a
slight salute to the rest of the company, she
took her way out of the house. Falkenberg
had not said a word either for or against
her resolution to go out alone.</p>

<p>She left the garden, pausing once again to
contemplate with a peculiar pleasure the old
grey gateway, and to read over the inscription,
which seemed now to have a new meaning
for her.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mein Genügen</i>,’ she thought. ‘Yes, I
should fancy that that man would make a
“contentment” wherever he goes. There
is the harmony of a strong soul at peace with
itself and the world, in all he says and does.
But I wonder he is not married. I could
imagine some woman being very much in
love with him; and if he loved her, he would

<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>

most assuredly make her happy. Well, Carla
says that with the exception of her husband
and herself, the nicest people are not
married.’</p>

<p>She smiled as she remembered that saying,
and, looking up, found herself again in the
centre of the Marktplatz, which was empty
of all human life.</p>

<p>The afternoon was hot, and the sun shone
bakingly upon the round stones which paved
the square. A drowsy calm hung over everything.
Sara, pausing, looked around her,
trying to choose some vantage-ground from
which to sketch the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>. She perceived
that to the left of it, immediately under its
wall, there were steps leading into a kind of
small retired square, which looked shady and
cool. Not a good position from which to
make her sketch, but it was inviting. The
ardour for work had left her. Ever since
last night she had been longing intensely to
be alone. She bent her steps towards the
spot, ascended the low, broad flight of stone
stairs, and found herself in a square, shady,

<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>

gravelled space, in the midst of which rose a
heavy, tasteless-looking stone monument,
something between an ambitious tombstone
and a grovelling obelisk. She walked up to
it and looked at it. It bore a long list of
names, and an inscription to the effect that
the town of Lahnburg raised this humble
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Denkmal</i> to the memory of those of her sons
who had died fighting for <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kaiser und Vaterland</i>,
in 1870-71. There were the regiments
to which the deceased had belonged, their
ages, and the names of the engagements in
which they had fallen—Sedan, Metz, Saarbrück,
etc. And below all, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Auf Wiedersehen!</i>
Sara read it all, strangely moved by its
homely simplicity, the confident expression
of belief in a meeting again, and touched by
the profound peace of this quiet <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ruheplatz</i>—so
fitting for those brave hearts. At one side
of the square there was a low wall, and some
seats before it, on one of which she seated
herself, and found that it commanded a
glorious view of the low-lying country through
which there the Lahn flows. The great, cool

<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>

shadow of the cathedral was cast over her,
while beneath her eyes the fertile land lay
spread under a quivering veil of golden sun-pierced
mist.</p>

<p>It was a feast for eye and heart. The
artist soul of the woman drank in all the
broad, calm, peaceful beauty of it, and her
eyes dwelt lovingly upon every exquisite
curve of distant hill, on every silver link in
the windings of the placid river. She put her
hand upon her sketch-book—opened it; even
took her pencil in her hand; then laid it
down again, with a restless sigh breaking
from her lips. She felt the need of being
alone, and yet, now that she was alone, she
dreaded to acknowledge her own state of
mind to herself. Her thoughts were vague
and disconnected. There was a prevailing
sensation that the old life no longer satisfied
her. She knew that between her and her
rejoicing fulness of contentment in her art, a
barrier had arisen. A third thought now
always intruded between herself and her purpose.
She could handle no pencil, take up

<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>

no book, behold no beautiful thing, form no
plans for the future, without the influence of
Jerome Wellfield making itself overpoweringly
felt. At times—at this moment, even—she
almost resented this new feeling;
longed for freedom, and revolted at finding
her soul enslaved. She felt a tremor sometimes—the
unspoken question tormented her,
‘What if this passion be all wrong, instead
of all right? What if it paralyse, instead of
expanding, my nature? If it so absorb me
that I can forget others—forget, for one moment,
my highest aims—then it is surely
wrong. A love that is pure and true ought
to make one more unselfish, ought to make
one love better and more largely and liberally
everything and every person about one. Is
it so with me?’</p>

<p>Some such thought as this was agitating
her mind this afternoon. She was striving to
be reasonable, to keep her head steady in the
midst of her heart’s wild storm—piteously
striving, while the tyrant sentiment shook her
with ruthless hand; while between her and

<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>

the wholesome outside nature, came the beautiful
face which now haunted her thoughts so
doggedly, and beyond the twitter of the hopping
birds about and above her, sounded that
voice to which every fibre had thrilled, every
sense had responded, last night. A lark suddenly
rose, fluttering aloft, pouring out a
full-hearted song—such a flood of trilling
ecstasy as must have nearly burst his little
throat. She heard it, and it troubled her; it
interrupted the memory of that other song, in
such weird contrast to this one, which Jerome
had sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container40">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse first-line">‘In dreams I saw thy face,</div>
     <div class="verse indent2">And saw the night</div>
     <div class="verse indent1">Filling thy heart’s drear space,</div>
     <div class="verse indent2">And saw the snake</div>
     <div class="verse indent1">That gnaws that heart apace.</div>
     <div class="verse indent2">I saw, my love,</div>
     <div class="verse indent1">Thy great and sore distress;</div>
     <div class="verse indent2">I murmur not.’</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>‘What am I thinking of?’ she almost
uttered, starting quickly. ‘I am nervous. I
must be. Why didn’t I go to those Lehnberg
girls and be amiable to them, instead of standing

<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>

aloof and helping Carla to be ill-natured,
for I know she dislikes them. I should have
felt better now, had I done so. I am degraded
by indulging in this folly, and I——’</p>

<p>‘Surely, Miss Ford, you did not think this
the best place from which to sketch the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>?’
said Falkenberg’s voice, just beside her.</p>

<p>Sara turned slowly, too thoroughly absorbed
in her own thoughts to be startled. Her eyes
dwelt at first almost unrecognisingly upon his
face. There was trouble in them—a kind of
pained, hunted look. Gradually they cleared,
as she came down again into the world of
reality, and saw him stooping towards her.
He was alone. Her troubled heart grew
calmer, as she saw his good face, and grave,
critical brown eyes, full of wisdom and full of
kindness, fixed upon her.</p>

<p>‘Whatever this man told me, I should
believe implicitly,’ she thought within herself,
and she smiled welcome to him. Indeed, she
did welcome him in her heart. He came as
a deliverer. Her thraldom had begun to gall
her, when he appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>‘Where have you left the countess?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>‘At my house. She discovered that she
could not walk so far as the others were
going, and that she wished to inspect my
house and farm and gardens; for she was
certain that she could find a great deal to improve
in all of them.’</p>

<p>He smiled, and so did Sara, the latter of
course being unconscious of the additional
remarks made by the candid countess when
alone with her favourite guest—remarks which
it had required all his tact to receive with an
appearance of amused indifference.</p>

<p>‘Ah, she is not fond of walking. You
may well ask if I thought this a good place
from which to sketch the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>. I came
down here, and then found that I was not
inclined to draw. I hope you do not feel
that you have been beguiled here on false
pretences.’</p>

<p>‘By no means. I am glad you don’t wish
to draw; perhaps you will be all the more
disposed to converse.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>‘If you will “introduce a subject,” as they
did in the old game, I shall be delighted.’</p>

<p>‘I have a subject quite ready. I hope you
will not think me very impertinent for introducing
it; and if you consider my questions
unwarrantable, tell me so, and I will apologise
and be silent.’</p>

<p>‘Now I know you are going to ask me
questions about myself, which I give you free
leave to do. I know of absolutely nothing in
my life which I care to conceal.’</p>

<p>‘Then, do you live entirely at Elberthal?’</p>

<p>‘I have lived there now for two years,
entirely, except when friends have invited me
to visit them.’</p>

<p>‘And alone?’</p>

<p>‘Alone, except for my old servant, Ellen,
my second mother, who lives with me.’</p>

<p>‘And you have neither father nor mother?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘No! My mother died when I was a
baby, almost.  My father worshipped her.
He never married a second time.  Nearly
three years ago he also died. I have very

<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
few relations, and those not congenial. I

may therefore say, I am alone in the world.’</p>

<p>‘And—and—excuse the question,’ he said,
flushing violently, so that she looked at him
in surprise. ‘Are you—but really, I have no
right to ask.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, Herr Falkenberg?’</p>

<p>‘I wondered whether you were entirely
dependent on your art, for——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I thought you were going to ask, like
my aunt in England, what I did when I was
asked out, and had no chaperon to take me,’
said Sara, laughing. ‘Am I dependent on
my art for the means of subsistence? No!
I have just one hundred pounds a year of my
own, Herr Falkenberg, safe and secure.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad of that,’ said he, with a sympathetic
smile of relief. ‘It makes all the
difference. With that income certain, you
may live to your art as art.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I find it a very good thing. My
hundred a year is worth a thousand to me, I
assure you. But what a paltry little sum it
must appear to you,’ she added, with a look

<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>

of humour in her grey eyes. ‘What was it I
once read about “spinsters and widows of
one or two hundred a year, and other
minute capitalists of the same kind?” I
remember being very much amused with it.
Do you not almost feel to require a magnifying-glass—mental,
I mean—to enable you
to see my hundred a year at all—you with
your immense transactions, and your great
income?’</p>

<p>‘My dear Miss Ford,’ he expostulated,
blushing as if to apologise for having such a
large income when she had such a very small
one, ‘pardon me; I ought never to have
alluded——’</p>

<p>Sara laughed with hearty enjoyment.</p>

<p>‘Do not look so distressed,’ she said.
‘When I think how frightened I was at the
countess’s account of you, and how I quaked
when I saw her bringing you up to me yesterday,
and then realise your goodness—why
should you not ask how much money I have,
and why should I not tell you that I have a
hundred a year? I think there is such an

<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>

immense amount of false delicacy wasted
upon such matters.’</p>

<p>‘Yet I know that you would not think of
asking me what my income is,’ said Falkenberg,
composedly.</p>

<p>‘There is a difference between a great
financier and a “minute capitalist” like
myself. Have you some plan for turning
my hundred a year into two?’ she added,
laughing.</p>

<p>‘No; I was innocent of wishing to speculate
with your money. I was only anxious
to know that you were not obliged to speculate
with your brains.’</p>

<p>‘No; I have been most fortunate, I consider,
in that respect. When I first went to
Elberthal I was certainly seriously puzzled to
arrange my affairs, from a poverty of means,
not an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">embarras de richesses</i>. You see—I
daresay you can bend your comprehension
to the fact—it <em>was</em> a little difficult to make a
hundred a year pay for board and lodging for
two, and for my lessons as well.’</p>

<p>‘It must have been impossible,’ exclaimed

<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>

Falkenberg, looking so shocked that Sara
laughed again gleefully.</p>

<p>‘I am sure I could “harrow you up,” as
the Americans say, if I were to relate some
of Ellen’s and my contrivances at that time.
We both were inspired with a Spartan resolution
not to get into debt if we had to starve
for it.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot conceive how you lived,’ he said,
in a voice which had actual pain in it. ‘How
can you laugh at it? It is shocking. What
were your friends doing to allow——’</p>

<p>‘Oh! my friends were few, and they were
all so angry at the course I had taken, that
they would have rejoiced in the idea that I
was being humbled—that perhaps I should
be obliged to return home. But I was going
to tell you how we went on—if you want to
hear, that is.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if you will be so good as to tell me!’</p>

<p>‘I had lessons from Wilhelmi; I daresay
you know him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘He is a splendid fellow, do you know?

<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>

At first I had great difficulty in getting him
to teach me at all. Then he suddenly became
quite kind. I believe it was as soon as he
saw that I meant work, and not nonsense.
He was good enough to say that I had talent,
and since then he will accept absolutely
nothing from me for my lessons. He says I
can give him a service of plate, with inscriptions,
when I am a popular painter. Is not
that noble generosity?’</p>

<p>‘Very kind,’ assented Falkenberg, almost
coldly.</p>

<p>‘And his wife and daughter have been
almost as kind as himself. I feel that they
are friends indeed.’</p>

<p>‘But your people at home?’ he began.</p>

<p>‘All my “people at home” consist in an
uncle, a brother of my mother’s, and his
family. My father was professor of modern
history at —— College, in London. His
opinions, both religious and social, were advanced.
When he was living, his house was
a favourite place with clever, cultivated men
and women, of all shades of opinion; most

<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>

of them, like himself, not particularly well off.
Then he died, suddenly, and left me, as I
said, with one hundred pounds a year. I
was just one-and-twenty, and my small possessions
were fortunately absolutely at my
own disposal. I tried living with “my people
at home.” My uncle is a clergyman; rector
of a very small village in the south of England.
They exist there; they don’t live. It
soon grew intolerable to me. I had been
accustomed to the society of men and women
of mind; and the gossip about the curate,
and my cousins’ frantic efforts to imitate the
dress of the county ladies who occasionally
came to church, and who most likely spent as
many hundreds on their clothes as Charlotte
and Louisa had sovereigns, drove me almost
wild. Then the curate tried to convert
me——’</p>

<p>‘Heavens!’</p>

<p>‘And I spoke disrespectfully of the Church.
My aunt and cousins were speechless, and
sent me to Coventry for a long time. I remembered
how well my pictures had sold at

<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>

some fancy fairs and bazaars in London, to
which I had sometimes contributed, and I
resolved that I would use the powers God
had given me. I laid all my plans in silence,
only taking my old Ellen into my confidence.
She vowed she would follow me to the
world’s end.’</p>

<p>‘Of course!’</p>

<p>‘Of course? Not at all. She had an
excellent situation offered her, as housekeeper,
in an English country house, where
she could have done as she pleased, and
where she also would have received a hundred
a year. When incomes dwindle down to
hundreds, Herr Falkenberg, one finds one’s-self
on a pecuniary level with strange companions
sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘How you harp upon that stupid hundred
pounds!’ exclaimed Falkenberg. ‘I believe
you wish to defy me with it. Well?’</p>

<p>‘She gave it up, and accompanied me.
There was a storm at the rectory when I
unfolded my plans. My uncle forbade me
to go, and said it would have broken my

<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>

mother’s heart.’ Her lip curled scornfully.
‘My mother, who always taught me that no
kind of work was shameful, and that every
kind of idleness was! Naturally I took no
notice of that. My cousins said I was a
Bohemian, and liked adventures, and that it
all came of my having been brought up
amongst unbelievers. My aunt was speechless
for a time, and then said, “Go abroad,
child, alone! What will you do for a
chaperon, when you are invited anywhere?”’</p>

<p>‘And you?’ he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>‘I said, “I suppose I shall go without
one.” And then I came to Elberthal. I
have been there now for two years. One of
my cousins occasionally writes to me, and I to
her. The rest ignore me. And I—have learnt
to live alone. With plenty of work it is not
so very difficult, and the depraved nature
of the German customs has even allowed me
to go out without a chaperon now and then,
without visiting the sin too severely upon me.’</p>

<p>‘Then how did you meet with the
Trockenaus?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Sara, a smile of pleasure flashing
over her face, ‘that was another pleasant
thing. Count Trockenau was once a student
in the very college in which my father was
professor of history, and had attended some
of his lectures; and, it seems, had been at his
house, and seen me when I was a mere child.
I don’t remember it, but he does. They saw
a picture with my name, at an exhibition in
Berlin; and he actually took the trouble to
ascertain whether I had anything to do with
the Professor Ford he had known. That is
a year ago; since then, they have been unvaryingly
kind to me. But people are kind,
it seems to me. As for Countess Carla—she
is goodness itself.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; there is a wonderful charm about
her,’ he said, and then they were both silent
for a time.</p>

<p>Her clear grey eyes were fixed upon the
fields below them—eyes so perfectly true,
pure, and candid, he thought he had never
seen. Now also, he saw the slight line about
the mouth—a line which was sometimes a

<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>

little hard, as if struggle and disillusionism
had called it there. Her open gaze, her
fearless smile, her unembarrassed manner of
holding her way through the world—what
was it all? Innocence, most assuredly; but
ignorance—no. She knew the world, and
knew that it was evil. He thought that in
addition to innocence there was perfect comprehension
of her position, great ambition, a
great deal of pride, and, mixed with that, a
touch of indifference that was almost cynical.
She did not sneer; there was no sneer on the
beautiful frank mouth, but there was disdain.
He had never seen anything quite like her
before. As he sat, looking earnestly at her,
he began to reflect that very soon she would
pass from his life. This conversation in the
afternoon sunshine, under the shadow of the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dom</i>, was pleasant—as sweet as it was
unexpected, and different from all other conversations
he had ever had. But soon it
would be over. After a few days at Trockenau,
she would return to her atelier; he to
his business and his—pleasures. His pleasures,

<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>

as he looked back upon them now,
seen in the light of <em>this</em> sun, looked grey and
dim and poor. Of course he need not lose
sight of her, and the most natural way of
keeping her in view, considering their relative
positions, would be to give her a commission
to paint him a picture. He felt himself revolted
at the idea—felt the blood rise to his
cheeks at the thought. Surely there must be
some other way of keeping her in sight.</p>

<p>At this moment she turned, and found his
eyes so intently fixed on her face, that her
colour too rose a little, as she asked:</p>

<p>‘Have I said something that shocks you
too, Herr Falkenberg? I should be sorry
for that.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Ford!’ he exclaimed earnestly,
‘what you have told me makes me honour
and respect you from my very soul. Do not
for a moment think that your confidence has
been misplaced, as it must have been if I
were “shocked” at anything you have said.
We only met yesterday, and yet I am bold
enough to say that if you would consent to

<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>

place me on the list of your friends and
servants, I should indeed feel honoured.’</p>

<p>Sara looked at him with eloquent eyes and
parted lips.</p>

<p>‘You are very kind,’ she said earnestly,
‘and I accept your kindness. I—my friends
are not many, but they are prized. I should
think it a privilege to count you amongst
them, for I believe you have the same
feelings about friendship that I have myself,
and my ideas on the subject are by no means
low ones.’</p>

<p>‘Nor mine. And for that reason I am
like yourself. My friends are few,’ he said,
taking the hand she extended, and raising it
to his lips, his eyes still fixed on her face.
Suddenly her own eyes filled with tears.
She turned aside her face, and covered it
with her other hand.</p>

<p>‘What have I done to deserve such kindness?’
she said tremulously, and profoundly
moved. And indeed, what is there that
should move a human soul more than such a
discovery as this—the discovery of a friend?

Schiller felt it when he sang in that great
ode, which never has been and never can be
translated without being ruined:</p>

<div class="poetry-container38">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>‘It is not kindness so much as selfishness,’
said he, gently. ‘Do we not all try
to grasp that which seems very desirable to
us?’</p>

<p>‘It is a kind of selfishness I like,’ said
Sara, recovering, and flashing a bright glance
upon him through the mist which still veiled
her eyes.</p>

<p>‘I should like to take you to one or two
places here—Lotte Buff’s house, and Goethe’s
Well, and some others, if you would care to
go,’ he said, as if to put aside her still unspoken
thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>‘I should, immensely. Shall we have
time before the others come back? Where
are they gone, by-the-way?’</p>

<p>‘They are gone to a celebrated restauration
on the top of that hill, the Kalsmund,
which you see opposite, with the ruined
tower upon it. At this restauration they are
famed for their <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bowle</i>—pineapple <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bowle</i>; and
I heard young Lemde, and the count, and
Arthur Eckberg arranging to take the ladies
there and have a large bowl of the said
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bowle</i>, in the garden of the restauration,’ said
Falkenberg, with an imperturbable gravity
which the light in his eyes belied.</p>

<p>Sara laughed.</p>

<p>‘Should we not rather go and find the
countess, and ask her to come with us? I
am sure she will be dull.’</p>

<p>Accordingly they went to the house, and
found the countess nothing loath to accept
their invitation that she would accompany
them. They had a very delightful tour of
discovery; and Sara noticed that wherever
they went, their companion appeared to be

<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>

known, and that he was greeted with smiles
and a pleasant word.</p>

<p>When it was time they returned to the
house, and found the rest of the party there,
all in the highest good-humour, and all pitying
them for having missed the treat they
had had—the walk, the view, the ruins, and
the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bowle</i>.</p>

<p>It was time to go to the railway station,
and after a railway journey of one hour and a
drive of another, they found that their <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Landpartei</i>
was over, and they were again at
Schloss Trockenau.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">At</span> Ems, the morning of the same
day, some time after the Trockenau
procession had gone past on
its way to the station, two young ladies
seated themselves on a bench in the Kurgarten,
beside the broad walk. They had
brought their novels and their fancy-work,
and were of one mind and one spirit in their
purpose to idle away the morning, watch the
visitors, and, after the manner of Miss
Austen’s sarcastic heroes and ingenuous
heroines, ‘quiz the company.’ They were
English; they were the daughters of an
M.P. for one of the great manufacturing

<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>

towns. They were staying at the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vier
Jahreszeiten</i>, and they had closely observed
all the rest of the company staying there.
Until a few days ago, the most perfect sisterly
harmony had reigned between them; but a
lamentable discord had lately arisen, and that
upon the subject of a man.</p>

<p>‘Dora, see! There’s your wonderful dark
angel coming mooning along with his sister.
Pray don’t miss the chance of looking at them,
since you admire them so much.’</p>

<p>‘You are boiling over with spite, Lucy. I
will look at them. I like looking at them,
and so do you, but you won’t own it.’</p>

<p>‘<em>I!</em>’ ejaculated Lucy, with supreme contempt.
‘He is very handsome, I grant you;
but I believe him to be a sham.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by a sham?’</p>

<p>‘He looks like a hero of romance, and I
believe he is a very commonplace personage
after all.’</p>

<p>‘No one with such a voice could be
commonplace, Lucy. Sims Reeves is nothing
to him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>‘I should say you were cracked,’ replied
Lucy, witheringly.</p>

<p>‘Should you? What a powerful imagination
you must have! He is coming down
this way. I am sure “a dark angel” is an
excellent name for him.’</p>

<p>‘I shall conclude next that you write
poetry about him—a man who has never
spoken to you, and who doesn’t recognise
you when he sees you.  And as for that
tall girl, with her streams of yellow hair, she
ought in decency to put it up, in——’</p>

<p>‘In a chignon—do say a chignon at once!
It would suit her so admirably—about as
well as it would suit Venus or Hebe.’</p>

<p>‘We shall never agree about them, that is
evident.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I know that. Do let me admire
them in peace. ’Tis all I ask.’</p>

<p>The causes of this deplorable breach of
good understanding between two generally
loving sisters, were now too near for them to
exchange any further remarks about them
at present. Lucy indignantly stuck her

<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>

parasol between herself and them, and studied
her Tauchnitz volume in moody dignity.
Dora, perfectly conscious that the Wellfields
were unaware of her existence, had no
scruple in raising her head as they went
past, and looking at them openly and scrutinisingly.
They did not see her, being
absorbed in conversation, and looking intently
at one another. Avice was hanging
upon her brother’s arm, which she had taken
as they left the hotel, and was gazing with a
sort of rapt attention into his face, as if something
in his looks or his voice attracted her
irresistibly. He had been saying something,
and had ceased to speak, and this something
seemed to give her matter for thought. Soon
after they had passed the two girls, Avice said:</p>

<p>‘Jerome, since I knew you—how long is it?’</p>

<p>‘It is just a month since I came to you
here.’</p>

<p>‘It seems an eternity of pleasure. My
life has changed so much since then that I
hardly know myself.’</p>

<p>‘For the better, do you mean?’ he asked,

<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>

looking down upon the delicately beautiful,
upturned face, and feeling that Sara Ford’s
words had been true: ‘She will some day
be remarkably beautiful.’</p>

<p>‘For the better, of course. I used to be
very tired of my life sometimes. Often I
have sat in our balcony, when we had one at
any hotel we were staying at, and envied the
ragged children playing in the street.’</p>

<p>‘But why, child? My father seems to
dote upon you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! he dotes upon me, I suppose.
But when the doting takes the form of
scarcely allowing me to leave the house, and
never to go out alone—in all the places we
have been at, I never went to see the sights
like other girls—I am so ignorant—you cannot
imagine <em>how</em> ignorant. I know absolutely
nothing.’</p>

<p>‘You know French and German, and
Italian and English.’</p>

<p>‘What is that, when I am afraid to speak
in them for fear of showing what an ignorant
little fool I am!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>‘And you know politics. I sat in silent
awe and amazement the other day when you
were telling my father about the ministerial
tactics in France and England.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! because I have read the papers to
papa for years. I don’t know any grammar,
nor any arithmetic, nor——’</p>

<p>‘What can you want with them? Grammar
is bosh.’</p>

<p><em>‘Jerome!’</em></p>

<p>‘Of course it is bosh. Never be afraid to
call it bosh. And as for arithmetic, you can
add up what you receive and what you spend,
I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t mean that kind of arithmetic.
I knew an English girl a little while ago
where we were at Florence. She was spending
the winter holidays there, and papa
allowed me to go to see her sometimes. She
showed me the work she had to do during the
holidays, and it made me feel, oh, so fearfully
ignorant. One of her sums was, “Find
the present value of £760 at four and five-eighths
per cent. for eighty days.” That is

<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>

what <em>I</em> call arithmetic,’ said Avice, despondently.</p>

<p>‘Do you? Well, suppose we look out for
a governess for both of us, for I know just as
much about it as you do.’</p>

<p>Avice laughed and said: ‘It would have to
be a very clever governess, Jerome.’</p>

<p>‘But not old and ugly, or I could not
possibly learn from her; and yet, if she were
young and handsome, I might fall in love
with her. Upon my word, I think I should
like to have a governess, Avice. Shall we
see about it?’</p>

<p>‘How ridiculous you are! Since I have
had you, I don’t care so much about a
governess. How horribly frightened of you
I was, before I saw you. Papa used to pinch
my ear sometimes when he wanted to tease
me, and say, “I wonder what Hieronymus
will say when he first sees you—little interloper!”
When I asked what you were like,
he said I should have to mind my P’s and
Q’s with you. Naturally I trembled at the
very idea of beholding you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>‘It was too bad to make me out such a
bugbear.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he did not make you out a bugbear,
exactly; but he gave me a fearful idea of you.
And one day he told me that you had been
sent for—that was when he was ill, and
thought he would not get better. And he
added that when he was gone, you would
have all his authority, and that he advised
me to make myself agreeable to you. It was
woman’s mission, he said, to make herself
agreeable.’</p>

<p>‘My father has curious ideas upon woman’s
mission and place in life, my dear. If he
were to come in contact with the world again,
he would find that they were out of date.
Well?’</p>

<p>‘I was in the greatest anxiety. I did not
know whether to put on my oldest, shabbiest
frock, and to go and sit up in my bedroom,
and not come down till I was sent for, and
not speak till I was spoken to.’</p>

<p>‘What end did you purpose to serve by
such a course?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>‘I thought you would think, “At least she
is quite insignificant, and will not be in my
way.” Then I thought it might be better to
make myself look as well as I possibly
could——’</p>

<p>‘Which you knew to be very well indeed,
Miss Vanity, in your bronze velvet gown
with the amber slashings, which makes you
look like some picture of Titian or Veronese,
but which would not lead anyone to suppose
that you were an English school-girl.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t call me an English school-girl.
I think they are horrid.  They know so
much more than I do. But do you like me
in that dress?’</p>

<p>‘Very much.’</p>

<p>‘I thought, well, if he sees me in this, he
will think, “Ah, after all she is presentable.
She might be worse.”’</p>

<p>‘Preposterous child! Finally, if I remember
aright——’</p>

<p>‘Finally, papa was so ill that I forgot all
about my dress. I was in a black frock, sitting
beside his bed, I know, when you came.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, I remember. My eyes fell upon
you the instant I came in. I remember
being struck, then and there, with the contrast
between your white face and black dress, and
great startled eyes, and this flood of gold,
Avice.’ He smiled slightly as he touched a
tress of her hair.</p>

<p>‘And I remember that as you came in, I
really turned cold with anxiety and alarm.
You were pale too, and your eyes seemed to
burn upon me. I remember how you walked
up to my father, and bent over him, and I
thought suddenly, “Oh, I hope he will like
me!” Then papa remembered me, and took
my hand, and said, “Here’s Avice—you
must learn to know her, for when I’m gone
she will have no one but you; and she is a
hot-house plant, I can tell you.” And you,
Jerome, you took my hand—I could not
speak. You smiled at me, and I felt as if a
tight string had been cut loose from my
heart; and you said, “One only needs to
look at her to see that.” I must have looked
alarmed, for you said, “Do you think you

<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>

can spare me a little of your regard, my
child?” and you put your arm round me,
and kissed me. I would have <em>died</em> for you,
Jerome, from that moment,’ she concluded,
looking into his face with eyes full of suppressed,
passionate devotion.</p>

<p>‘Why, you never told me before anything
of this,’ he said, in some surprise.</p>

<p>‘Because I waited to see if you would
change; if you would presently begin to
think me an interloper. But I know you
don’t. Oh, I do so love you!’</p>

<p>He took her chin in his hand, and looked
down into the glowing, excited young face;
then stooped and kissed her, saying: ‘I
only wish we had not been strangers so
long.’</p>

<p>They turned back, having come to the end
of the garden, and Avice went on:</p>

<p>‘I have a great many things to ask about,
Jerome. First, I want to know if we are
rich?’</p>

<p>‘Rich! No. At least, not millionaires.
I don’t exactly know what my father’s

<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>

income is. Somewhere about two or three
thousand a year, I suppose. He has always
allowed me six hundred, since I came of age;
and it has been quite enough.’</p>

<p>‘But you lead such a simple life, compared
with that of some young men.’</p>

<p>He looked at her, surprised. ‘What do
you know about the lives “some” young men
lead?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know anything, except that most
of papa’s gentlemen friends spend more than
six hundred a year, I am sure. I could not
help seeing things, when we have stayed in
so many places. You don’t keep a lot of
horses, nor play cards for large stakes, nor
give grand entertainments, nor spend heaps
of money on dress.’</p>

<p>‘In all those matters I am severely virtuous,
I confess—at any rate, in the last. At
the same time, my sweet child, I have always,
by dint of unwearying exertions, contrived to
live up to my income; and perhaps had it
been larger even, I might have succeeded in
spending it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>‘I daresay; but you know what I mean.
You would never be like young Baron
Zeppenheim, for instance, whom we knew at
Wiesbaden. I really believe he had hundreds
of suits of clothes.’</p>

<p>Jerome laughed.</p>

<p>‘I think, sister mine, that such things have
about the same significance for us both.
You look charming in your bronze velvet,
with the old Venetian clasps; but had you
nothing to wear but some old black serge,
you would still be what you are.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so. I cannot imagine what
difference it makes. But next I want to ask,
have you ever been to our home—our real
home that belongs to us—and has the same
name as ourselves?’</p>

<p>‘Have I ever been at Wellfield? Of course
I have—ages ago, though, when I was a boy
of ten or eleven—nearly sixteen years ago,
Avice; and yet I remember it as well as if it
had been yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘Is it nice?’</p>

<p>‘It is a fine old place—yes—in a fine

<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>

country. I should like well to see it
again.’</p>

<p>‘I want to go there dreadfully, Jerome.
Couldn’t you persuade papa to let us go and
stay there for a while when he gets better?
He never will talk to me about it. He says
it is a musty old place, and that I may think
I should like it, but that I should be like himself
if I got there—dead in a week, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">aus lauter
Langeweile</i>. But I know better. I should
be able to do as I liked, and to go out without
a maid, and without gloves; and could have a
room of my own to put my things in, without
the horrid consciousness that in a week or
two I should have to rout them all out again.
That’s what I feel here; I feel an outcast.’</p>

<p>‘You have never seen the home of your
ancestors, and you are sixteen! I never in
the least realised it. Certainly you shall go.
I will work him up to it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Jerome, you are an angel!’ she exclaimed
fervently.</p>

<p>They were passing the English sisters
again, who had quarrelled about them; and

<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>

on hearing this exclamation, and seeing the
enraptured face held up to Jerome, ‘Dora’
gave an exultant glance towards ‘Lucy,’ who
merely shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Were you so anxious to see the old place?’
pursued Jerome. ‘Well, I don’t wonder. It
is a place to be proud of.’</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you go and live there? You
could.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that is another thing. Wellfield is a
lovely spot, and the Abbey is a place to be
proud of, no doubt; but to live there, after
the kind of life one has been accustomed to
here—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c’est autre chose</i>! It’s a Roman Catholic
neighbourhood. Brentwood is close to, you
know—the great Jesuit seminary, and a lot of
those fossilised Roman Catholic gentry, as
proud as Lucifer, and as exclusive as—as
only such people can be.’</p>

<p>‘But surely we are their equals.’</p>

<p>‘Oh dear, yes! We have always been on
the best of terms with them all, chiefly
perhaps because we have been so little at
Wellfield that there has been no time or

<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>

chance for differences to arise.  I don’t know
how I should like it to live in, unless——’</p>

<p>‘Unless what?’</p>

<p>‘If something I should like very much took
place, I should certainly ask my father to let
me take up my abode at the Abbey. Who
knows, Avice, under what circumstances you
may go first to Wellfield Abbey?’</p>

<p>They found themselves opposite the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vier
Jahreszeiten</i>. Jerome looked at his watch.</p>

<p>‘I tell you what, young lady, we have consumed
no end of time in this discussion. My
father will think himself ill-used. We promised
to walk with him at twelve. Come and
let us find him.’</p>

<p>They went into the hall, and an attendant
hurried up to them, only to say that Mr.
Wellfield the elder had been taken very ill
while reading his newspapers before rising,
that a doctor had been sent for, and that he
lay now between life and death.</p>

<p>Jerome and his sister hastened upstairs, and
found their father in alternate convulsions of
pain and intervals of utter, swooning unconsciousness.

<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>

The doctor came, and after a
very short examination pronounced the attack
to be a most serious one. A Sister of Mercy
from a neighbouring institution was sent for.
Hours of suspense and anxiety passed before
the delirious anguish of the patient at all
abated. The dusk of evening had fallen,
when the doctor, coming into the salon, found
Jerome and Avice seated together in the
window; the girl’s head pillowed on her
brother’s knee, her hand in his.</p>

<p>‘Your father is now composed, and perfectly
sensible,’ said the doctor. ‘He is very
anxious to speak to you alone,’ he added, to
Jerome. ‘The Sister will wait in the ante-room.
Call her if there is the least need for
help. She knows what to do. I will look in
again about midnight.’</p>

<p>With a brief good-evening he was gone;
and Jerome, rising, went to his father’s room.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A LAMP</span> was brightly burning in the
sick-room, with a shade over it,
and so placed as not to dazzle the
invalid’s eyes. The Sister had left the room
when Jerome entered; and there was a stillness
as of death over everything. Jerome
went up to the bedside, and stooped over the
motionless figure lying back, nerveless and
exhausted, after the agonies of pain which
had shaken the already feeble frame. The
face upon which the lamplight shone was, or
had been, a fine one, as regarded features.
These bore little resemblance to those of his
son, though they, like Jerome’s, were finely

<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>

cut, pale, and clear. Now, they were wasted
and waxen in their languid weariness. A
high, somewhat bald forehead, a long,
slender, grey moustache gave a thoroughly
un-English appearance to the whole countenance.
As Jerome’s hands pressed the
bedclothes, and he stooped without speaking
over the pillow, the large closed eyelids were
raised, and a pair of strange bright blue eyes
were discovered, such eyes as are often the
token of a cool, self-seeking disposition—eyes
which contained a light and a life which not
even this day of mortal pain had been able
utterly to quench.</p>

<p>Face of father and face of son were near
together; the one evidently near death, the
other scarcely less pale, quite as still and
composed, yet eloquent of health and strength,
and early manhood’s pride and power.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Jerome, it is you?’ came in a feeble
voice from the patient.</p>

<p>‘I am thankful to hear that you are out of
pain, sir. My sister and I have passed some
anxious hours.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes; I feel easier now.’</p>

<p>He spoke so slowly, so languidly, and so
faintly, that the voice was scarce audible.</p>

<p>‘You sent for me; at least, Dr. Reichhardt
said you wished to see me.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I have something to say to you.
Sit down.’</p>

<p>Jerome seated himself on a chair which
stood beside the bed, and waited. Since
opening his eyes, and seeing his son stooping
over him, Mr. Wellfield had not closed them
again. They looked restlessly round—at the
ceiling, the wall, the window—anywhere,
except into his son’s face. It was some little
time before he spoke again; what he had to
say seemed to require a considerable effort of
some kind. At last, in a voice which had
suddenly gained strength, he said:</p>

<p>‘You don’t know what caused me to be so
suddenly taken ill to-day.’</p>

<p>‘I had not thought of the cause. I was
disturbed at the fact.’</p>

<p>‘I had a severe shock, after you went out
this morning.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>‘Indeed!’ said Jerome, with some animation;
‘I hope no carelessness——’</p>

<p>‘None at all, except the carelessness of
circumstances, which is apt to be astonishing
sometimes, especially to those who suffer
from it,’ he retorted, a sarcastic flavour in his
voice. ‘I ought to have spoken to you long
ago—long ago.’</p>

<p>Again he paused, and again Jerome waited.
He had not the faintest, most conjectural
idea of the subject upon which his father
desired to speak to him. He was beginning
now to wonder vaguely what it could be.
They had no confidences, this father and son.
Their tastes, habits, and dispositions had
always been utterly dissimilar. The elder
Wellfield had gone his own way, had led his
life of aimless travel from place to place,
generally from one fashionable foreign invalid
colony to another, accompanied by his
daughter and her maid, and by his own manservant.
His son had enjoyed the fullest
liberty to do the same; to live exactly as
seemed good in his own eyes, only receiving

<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>

long ago the curt recommendation to remember
who he was, and that there were some
things that a gentleman could never do.
‘No need to tell a gentleman what these
things are,’ he had further been informed.
‘If he be a gentleman, he will very soon
learn them for himself; if not, scorpions could
not whip the knowledge into him.’</p>

<p>Furnished with such a formula, or creed,
as the basis of his ethical system, Jerome
Wellfield had been left to his own devices.
Three times since his father’s second marriage,
Jerome had met and stayed with that
father. The first time Avice had been a
baby, on the other occasions she had been
visiting friends unknown to her brother.
Jerome and his father had always agreed
together perfectly well. Each was conscious
that the other had tastes and habits and views
of life which to himself would have been
most distasteful. Each had had civilisation
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savoir vivre</i> enough to ignore that altogether
during their brief glimpses of one
another. They had never quarrelled—they

<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>

had never been friends. Mr. Wellfield had
enjoyed his life of idle valetudinarianism—his
lazy days, his evenings at cards, or in reading-rooms,
or lighted gardens. Jerome had
enjoyed his life—his pleasant search after the
harmonious and the beautiful in life, in art, in
nature. He had gradually shut himself up in
his own reserve; in his over-refined cultivation
and fastidiousness; he had ‘built his
soul a lordly pleasure-house, wherein at ease
for aye to dwell,’ till now what was ugly and
coarse made him shudder, and gave him pain
that was almost physical. All this refinement,
he often told himself, was not essential to
him; he could do without it; poverty would
not be anything to dread, for one could have
simplicity therewith; the real bane of existence
was common, rampant, triumphant
philistinism. Wherever he went, he had
been well received, and generally flattered:
his beauty, his voice, the charm of his
manner alone, would have made him the
despair of prudent mothers, even as a detrimental;
but when to those advantages was

<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
added the primary one, that he was an only
son, heir to a fine estate, of unimpeachably
good and ancient name and lineage, an impartial
judge must confess that it was a great
thing that Jerome Wellfield had come out of
the ordeal, at least outwardly, unscathed,
calm, unperturbed, unvulgarised.</p>

<p>Open admiration and adulation had revolted
his fastidious soul. Till he met Sara
Ford, he had never gone further than a mild
flirtation with any girl, for he was hard to
please. But, having met her, all was changed.
Her beauty, her pride, her indifference, calm
and smiling, to what other women so eagerly
sought after—the fact that she was no easy
prize, despite her loneliness and her poverty,
had fired him. He had loved with a rapidity
and a passion which showed the strange
blending of north and south, of Italy and
England, that was in him, and that made him
what he was. And he, as little as anyone,
knew what he was. In him there were two
natures; he only knew one, for up to now
his mother’s side alone had grown and

<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>

flourished; he little knew the modifications
of southern character which he inherited from
that man beside whose bed he sat, waiting
for the disclosure which he struggled to
utter.</p>

<p>Born beneath southern skies, brought up
in his very early childhood in Italian cities,
these influences engraved themselves deeply,
indelibly upon his nature. The mother’s
blood streaked every thought, every impulse,
with a mixture of passion and indolence, fire
and superstition. That mother had been the
beautiful daughter of an old, impoverished
Sicilian house—a house which had never
before married out of its own nation and its
own sphere. To her son she bequeathed her
own hereditary tendencies—she had had
much of the indolence, all the superstition of
that glorious, yet degraded race of Magna
Græcia.</p>

<p>In after-days, when Jerome looked up into
the murky skies of Lancashire—those skies
which gloomed over the grey walls of his
father’s house—those deep, unspeakably blue

<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>

heavens whose glory bathed the marbles of
Venice, the quays of Naples, the ruins of
Rome, the pictures of Florence, whose
glamour lent itself to the whispering, rustling
grey of the olives on Mediterranean coast
terraces, and made the yellow sand more
yellow, the blue sea more deeply violet, the
white sail more dazzling—this remembered
heaven used to rush to his recollection with a
light that was almost lurid, and scattered
tones of a speech that was music seemed to
ring melodiously in his ears. Italy had
faded, yet her finger-mark remained ineffaceable
upon his innermost heart, as his mother’s
beauty remained upon earth, stamped in the
beauty of his own face and the melody of his
voice, which, so long as voice or feature
remained, should visibly and audibly attest
the presence upon earth of a land where
skies are warmer, where love is fiercer, where
passions run more quickly into white-hot
rages than in this humid isle of ours.</p>

<p>Another influence had been almost as strong
as that of Italy—as strong as any influence

<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>

which is not already in a man’s natural tendencies
can be—and that influence was
Germany. After a brief stay in England,
during which his father’s second marriage
had taken place, he had been sent to the
gymnasium of ——, where he had gone
through all the courses, and, besides the
regular school-training, had been trained also
in the school of music.</p>

<p>In that land his voice and his musical
powers formed a passport. By degrees, the
Italian ditties, with their oily sweetness,
slipped away, as they have the trick of doing,
from his tongue, and the rougher, deeper
songs of the Fatherland grew at home there.
Casting himself with eagerness into the art,
he grew more and more devoted to it, and
but for one thing he often felt as if he would
never care to leave this <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Deutschland</i>, this
home of mighty harmonies, this adopted
country. That one thing was the remembrance
of his home itself—of the weird,
ancient Abbey, with its dark, quaint gardens,
its cloisters beside the river; and the still

<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>

more ancient church which he dimly remembered.</p>

<p>Since his love for Sara Ford had arisen, he
had thought and dreamed still oftener of this
ancient place. Now he knew—he had thought
of it when he spoke to Avice that morning—that
with her by his side there was no place
he would so gladly go to, and stay there.
What a life they might lead—she with
her art, and he with his—and with their
love! He felt a thrill—felt the blood course
quickly on, as he pictured her—it was the
first time he had seen the picture clearly—with
him at Wellfield—his wife.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, when you know, you may blame
me; and yet—where would you have been
all these years if I had acted differently?
Did you know that Wellfield had ever been
entailed?’</p>

<p>‘I think I have heard something about
it,’ said Jerome, surprised at the abruptness
of the question, and roused from his
dream.</p>

<p>‘It was entailed until my father’s time.

<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>

He and your great-grandfather agreed to
cut it off.’</p>

<p>‘Did they? Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because the estate was thoroughly embarrassed,
and deep in debt, and they wanted
to restore it.’</p>

<p>‘Then they succeeded?’ asked Jerome, to
whom this was news, but who concluded that
they must have succeeded. Had there been
embarrassments, surely he would have heard
of them before now.</p>

<p>‘No; they did not. Neither of them had
the faintest notion of business’—it is to be
presumed that Mr. Wellfield was conscious of
himself possessing business talents of a
superior order. ‘They got money, but that
wasn’t improving the estate. They did not
retrench, and they spent nothing on improvements.
When I came into possession, I was
worse off than any Wellfield had ever been
before.’</p>

<p>‘I had no idea of that,’ said Jerome.</p>

<p>‘Of course you had not. How could you
have? It is a fact, nevertheless. I went

<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>

through some bitter experiences. I had all
their pride, and none of their resources. I
saw no way out of it. Your mother once
saw the place, and screamed at the very idea
of living there. She said she would die if
she had to live out of Italy. It was therefore
impossible for me to live on my estate, and
retrench, as almost any other man might have
done under the circumstances. Knowing
this, I kept you as much away from the place
as possible, lest you should get fond of it.
Things got worse and worse. After your
sister’s mother died, my own health failed,
and it became impossible for me to live in
England. I saw ruin staring me in the face.
I saw you, whom I wished never to be
troubled with sordid cares and anxieties,
growing up utterly unconscious of the kind of
lot that was hanging over you. I seemed to
see Avice, your sister, stinted of common
comforts, and perhaps reduced, as she grew
up, to earn her living as a governess, <em>she</em>—ordered
about by strange people, and breaking
her heart with fretting.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>‘Good God, sir! What must you have
gone through! And why did you not confide
in me? Anything in my power——’</p>

<p>‘But there was nothing in your power—that
is exactly it. I did the only thing that
could be done. I looked my circumstances
full in the face, and the sight was not inspiriting.
Presently came a man with what
I wanted—money—any amount of money.
I—I sold Wellfield.’</p>

<p>‘Sold it!’ echoed the young man, in a voice
of horror and incredulity combined, as he
started from his chair, and looked into his
father’s face. ‘You are dreaming. You
are delirious. Let me call Sister Ursula—you——’</p>

<p>‘Sit down again!’ said his father, turning
upon him eyes so calm and lucid in their
perfect reasonableness and self-possession, that
Jerome felt his very heart give way within
him.</p>

<p>This sin had been committed. He had
dreamed no ugly dream. He dropped into
his chair again, propped his head upon his

<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>

hands, and tried to take in what his father
went on to say.</p>

<p>‘I sold it for forty thousand pounds to a
man called Bolton, who had a wild desire to
have it. He had some odd crotchet about it.
It was a dream of his to have the old
place——’</p>

<p>‘But for you to dream of selling it,’ interrupted
the young man, with suppressed
passion.</p>

<p>‘Needs must when the devil drives. Had
you been in my position—but there, I won’t
argue. I did it. I sold it. I invested the
money, and——’</p>

<p>‘If the money is there, all is well,’ interrupted
Jerome, eagerly. ‘It can be bought
back again. That is what you mean, I
suppose. You want to explain why Avice
and I shall be poor and straitened after you
have gone. Never mind, sir; there will be
a pittance, I daresay. I am young. I can
work, and I will do so. When Wellfield is
ours again, we shall be content with very
little else. Do not reproach yourself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>‘What are you talking about?’ retorted
the other in a voice almost of anger, and the
drops stood on his brow, for it was hard work
to brave it out. ‘Do you suppose I should
have made all this circumstance about it if
the money had been there? I tell you the
money is gone. It was invested—half in
mortgages, and half in the Mutual Liability
Bank of ——.  The bank is gone—the
newspaper—this morning.  It was there I
saw it—made me ill. The bank is limited,
but the other half—liable—ah!’</p>

<p>His eyes closed; he sank back, his face
very pale. For a moment Jerome did not
move, but sat still, staring at the white face
with a blank, stupid gaze. Then he said,
quite audibly, for he had a vague impression
that his father was unconscious:</p>

<p>‘Sold it! I would as soon have thought
of selling my wife or my sister.’</p>

<p>‘Would you?’ replied his father, opening
his eyes unexpectedly upon Jerome. ‘When
misfortune has resulted from any course, it
is the easiest thing in the world to say you

<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>

would never have done it. Had I not done
it, you would have been a beggar years ago.
For purchasing you years of enjoyment and
prosperity, you reproach me. I have my
reward.’</p>

<p>There was a flash in this of the more than
dissimilarity of tastes which had, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au fond</i>,
existed always between father and son—the
absolute antagonism—until now delicately
glazed over into a semblance of indifference,
but ready to burst forth the moment that
really deep feelings were touched.</p>

<p>An angry, bitter retort was upon Jerome’s
tongue—the retort that his father, in purchasing
those ‘years of prosperity and
enjoyment,’ of which he made such a merit,
had incidentally purchased with them years
of something else—which years the young
man seemed to see now very clearly unrolling
themselves before him—drear and
bitter. But his father was about to leave the
world—there could be little doubt of that—and
there certainly was something in his
manner of doing it very strongly suggestive

<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>

of his having done the best for himself while
he lived—denied himself no luxury, made no
sacrifice, not even that very commonly
necessary sacrifice of early avowing an unpleasant
truth because it is right to do so—and
of his then quietly slipping away, and
leaving the son whom he had never accustomed
to work, and the daughter whom he
had taught to look upon luxury and refinement
as matters of course, to battle as best
they might with adverse circumstances.
This view of the case certainly did rush
very strongly over Jerome’s mind. His hot
southern blood drove some very bitter, sarcastic
comments to his lips; but suddenly
another feeling prevailed over them—a
feeling of cool, calm calculation; a sense
that there must be some way out of all this
coil, and a private resolve that this man who
had the Abbey now, should not keep it very
long. Mastering his hot and furious anger,
he said coldly:</p>

<p>‘It would be useless to dispute the matter.
The damage, it appears, is done. Wellfield

<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>

has passed away from us, and the poor
money you got for it has passed away too.
But I suppose your affairs are in the hands
of some man of business?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; Netley of Manchester knows all my
concerns. No doubt there will be a letter
from him immediately. He will have to
give you information, and settle it all
up.’</p>

<p>‘Netley of Manchester!’ said Jerome,
deliberately making a note of it. ‘Where
does he live?’</p>

<p>‘His offices are at 57, Canongate.’</p>

<p>Another note. Then Jerome said:</p>

<p>‘Have you any idea whether everything
will go—whether not even a pittance will be
left?—enough for Avice to live upon, while
I try to find something to do?’</p>

<p>He spoke coldly and hardly, and in a
matter-of-fact tone; but as he uttered the
words, a vision rose before him of Sara
Ford; of her eyes, as he had whispered to
her, ‘And do you understand?’ He shivered
a little. Mr. Wellfield, too, was moved by

<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>

his words; by this stern bringing to reality
and commonplace of the whole affair. He
gave a slight groan as he turned his head
restlessly, saying:</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. O God! I know nothing
about it. But’—his voice grew almost fierce—‘remember,
sir, as long as you have a
penny, your sister remains with you.’</p>

<p>‘I hope I know my duty towards my
sister, sir, as well as you appear to have
known yours to your daughter,’ returned
Jerome, in a voice of some astringency;
‘and——’</p>

<p>They had been parting words. The deathly
expression upon his father’s face alarmed
him. He rang the bell, and Sister Ursula
answered it. Restoratives were applied, but
in vain. The flame did not flicker up again.
In a very short time Jerome knew that the
face upon which he looked was dead—the
eternal repose had settled upon the features.
Clouds and tempests were over for him;
rocks and shoals of life beset the path of
him who was left. He who was taken had

<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>

slipped comfortably away. The pain of
want, of narrow circumstances, the smarting
for the sins of his fathers, had never been
his, nor the joy begotten of self-abnegation—the
peace that comes to one weary with a
burden gallantly borne.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jerome went into the salon again. The
lamp had been lighted. Avice sat on a
couch, her hands folded before her, her eyes
anxiously turned towards the door. She
sprang up as he came in.</p>

<p>‘Jerome, is he better? Has he gone to
sleep?’</p>

<p>‘He has gone to sleep, my love; but he
will never awaken again. He died just
now.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! is he dead?’</p>

<p>She clung to him, looking up into his face,
in which she saw nothing but a pale, fixed
calmness.</p>

<p>‘Dead, Avice. And you must brace yourself
up, and prepare for a trial, and that a
sore one. You asked me if we were rich,

<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>

dear, and I told you we had ample means.
It was not true, though I did not know it.
We have now either nothing, or next to
nothing. You asked me if we should go
back to Wellfield, and I promised that you
should soon go there. I cannot keep my
promise. Wellfield is no longer ours. We
have no home. To-morrow I will explain.
To-night I can only tell you the facts. You
said that your life had been happier since you
knew me. What do you say to your brother
and his kindness now?’</p>

<p>Her eyes were eloquent as she looked up
at him, and said, gravely and calmly:</p>

<p>‘I love my brother for trusting in me.
And he shall never hear a murmur from my
lips if he will continue to trust me and guide
me.’</p>

<p>As they stood together, they kissed one
another with a kind of solemnity. Life was
changed, but they still remained to sustain
one another.</p>

<small>AVICE READS A CHAPTER OF A NEW BOOK.</small><br></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> was no reason for, and no
wish to linger at Ems when the
necessary delay was over, and the
necessary business accomplished. In a week
from the time of Mr. Wellfield’s death,
Jerome and his sister proposed to leave the
place, on their way home. During this week,
Avice lived through more surprise, more
wonder, and more emotion, compressed into
seven short days, than had been contained
in seven long years of her former life.</p>

<p>Her brother and his character formed to
her a strange new book, which she was never
weary of studying. The outside of that

<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>

book was of the most alluring character;
and she, of an intensely receptive nature, and
intensely sensitive, too, to beauty, delighted
in that fair outside, in those polished manners,
in the smooth, calm, composed demeanour.
She delighted to go out with Jerome, to
behold others turning to look at him; in
every proof that she was not alone in her
sense of being fascinated by him. They
naturally went out little during those days of
waiting; when they did go, they went alone
together, avoiding the crowded gardens and
the more public walks. They had, therefore,
ample opportunity of learning more of one
another; and perhaps each modified the
estimate already formed of the other’s character.
But the affection increased. In their
long walks to the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it"> Concordia</i>, or along the
white country roads, Jerome told her about
all their circumstances—told her he did not
know whether they would have any secure
income, even the smallest, upon which to
live; asked her if she could reconcile herself
to existence with him, perhaps in a back

<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>

parlour of some dingy town-lodgings. To
all of which questions her ‘yes, oh, yes!’
leaped out with an eager readiness.</p>

<p>‘Now I begin to see what papa meant
when he kept calling me a little interloper,
Jerome,’ she said one day. ‘If it were not
for me, how much easier everything would
be for you. I have heard that a man, alone,
need never fear anything, even starvation;
but that when he has a woman with him
it clogs him, and paralyses him, and unfits
him——’</p>

<p>‘Hush, child!’ he said, putting his finger
on her lip, and smiling at the same time;
‘that is nothing less than blasphemy, and I
know where you learnt it.’</p>

<p>Avice hung her head. Presently she
looked up again, remarking:</p>

<p>‘Living with papa first, and then with you,
Jerome, is like going to school first with one
schoolmaster, and then with another; and one
uses the cane, and the other doesn’t.’</p>

<p>‘Is it?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes, with papa, the sensation was

<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>

just like what I could imagine a child feeling
on being told, “Hold out your hand.” Horrible!’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean——’ he began sharply.</p>

<p>‘That papa was cruel? Oh no! He
never meant to be, at any rate. I suppose
he could not help being cold and sarcastic
and severe in manner. What he hated most
was what he called drivelling sentimentality.
I always knew in an instant when I had said
something sentimental. And I think, as
long as I live, I shall never forget the tone
of his voice as he used to say, “That is
your view of the case, is it, mademoiselle?
Suppose we look at it in the light in which
persons of judgment will see it.” And then,
how foolish I was made to feel! Papa
certainly could put people down in a way I
never saw anyone else use.’</p>

<p>She sighed, and Jerome smiled rather
bitterly, commiserating the young creature
who had been trained in such a school.</p>

<p>‘She must be naturally gentle, I suppose,
or she would have been—good heavens! who

<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>

knows what she might have been at one-and-twenty?’</p>

<p>He could not but see, however, that she
had much of his own intense fastidiousness,
and that she was proud, and that frequently a
flash of the sarcasm from which she had
suffered would appear in her own remarks.
And he was in despair at the prospect of the
future which lay before her. Avice herself
did not give much thought to that future.
She was happier in the present than she ever
had been before.</p>

<p>The day came at last, the last day of their
stay at Ems. In the morning they were to
leave. Jerome strolled into their sitting-room
in the evening, and found Avice
there.</p>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gott sei dank!</i>’ he remarked. ‘All the
dismissals are over.’</p>

<p>He had been discharging his sister’s maid
and his father’s valet. For the future Avice
was to learn to mend and perhaps make her
own clothes, dress her own hair, and otherwise
become a useful and practical member
of society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>‘Then they are gone, Jerome?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, they are gone.’</p>

<p>‘Toinette came in floods of tears to say
adieu. “Ah, mademoiselle!” she exclaimed,
“when I reflect upon your hair, and your
desolation, without me, I am <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">près à
mourir</i>.”’</p>

<p>‘She will soon console herself. She was
flirting atrociously with the porter when I
went downstairs.’</p>

<p>‘And, Jerome, it has suddenly occurred to
me to ask you, at what hour do we start in
the morning, and by what route do we travel
to England?’</p>

<p>There was a pause, as she looked at him,
and saw that her brother’s eyes were fixed
upon a book upon the table, and that there
was an expression in his face which she did
not quite understand. At last he raised his
eyes, and said, with, as she thought, some
little constraint:</p>

<p>‘We must take the “cheapest and best”
route from the Continent, I suppose:
Cologne, Rotterdam, and Harwich. I am
sorry for you, my child, but——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, sorry, nonsense! I am not made of
white sugar, Jerome. Then, at what time must
we leave? Shall I have to get up very early?’</p>

<p>‘No earlier than usual, for I propose
breaking the journey, and staying all night
at Elberthal.’</p>

<p>‘At Elberthal? Why there? It is not a
pretty town, and Cologne is far more interesting,
though I am tired of it.’</p>

<p>‘I know Elberthal is not pretty. But
there is some one there whom I wish to see
before I go to England.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, is it anyone I know?’</p>

<p>‘I think you have seen her once or twice.
It is Miss Sara Ford.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Ford!’ repeated Avice, not at the
first moment comprehending. ‘That beautiful
Miss Ford who was with the Countess of
Trockenau so often? Is she a friend——’</p>

<p>Then, as she still continued looking at
Jerome, she understood in a moment, and
stopped abruptly. This was a new phase of
life, a fresh complication in her circumstances,
towards which her thoughts had

<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>

never before turned for a moment. For a
few moments she sat quite still, saying
nothing, pondering upon it; then, rising
quickly, she went to Jerome, and put her
arm round his neck.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Jerome,’ she murmured, in a half-tearful
voice, ‘how much you must have had
to suffer! I never knew till now what
“ruin” and having no money might mean.’</p>

<p>He returned her kiss, saying gently,
‘Never mind, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Liebchen</i>! Things may turn
out well in the end. And meantime, before
we face Manchester and ruin, there is Elberthal
to be passed.’</p>

<p>The following day they departed by the
afternoon boat from Ober-Lahnstein for
Cologne, thence to take the train to Elberthal.
It was a gorgeous afternoon, at the
very end of July. The sun was hot, the
river was smooth, the scenery was glowing,
the boat was full of gay parties of travellers
of all nations, when Wellfield and his sister
went upon it. A little after six they arrived
at Elberthal, and went to an hotel.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> daylight lasts late in July.
Though growing dusk in the
house, it was yet broad daylight
on the balcony of the room in which Jerome
left his sister, when he set out to find Sara
Ford’s house. It was still broad daylight out
of doors, and the streets were thronged with
pleasure-seekers, and with the feet of those
on business intent. He had Sara’s address—Jägerstrasse,
No. 42. He inquired the
way there, and was directed to go through
a pleasant green Hofgarten, whose cool
avenues and great trees were just now
glorified by the yellow rays of the setting

<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>

sun. Somewhere, in the direction of that
setting sun, he knew the Rhine wandered by
the town. He had heard Sara describe how
broad and strong was its course just there,
and what a fascination it had for her, despite
the unpicturesque, low, flat banks on either
side. As he went along, his heart was light,
despite the heavy load of cares and anxiety
which hung over him.</p>

<p>Sounds of music or singing greeted him
wherever he went, as they do in those
homely continental towns devoted to art and
to sentiment. There was a pleasant, homely
bustle going on. The town was small. One
could not easily have lost oneself in it. To
find the Jägerstrasse was no difficult matter,
and once there it was easier still to discover
No. 42, which was a great white house of
many stories, with an arched passage running
through it from front to back, and heavy iron
gates, at present thrown back. He went into
the passage, and to the side door, which had
the names of the different inhabitants put
up. ‘Miss S. Ford, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">2te Etage</i>,’ he read, and

<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>

pulled the bell twice. His summons was
presently answered by a middle-aged woman
with a strong, sensible, good English face,
about whose whole aspect there was a
harmony, and in whose dress there was an
appropriateness and suitability which were
nothing short of admirable.</p>

<p>‘Is Miss Ford at home?’ he asked, like
one in a dream; for, up to the moment of
pulling the bell, he had been engaged in a
puzzling mental debate as to whether he
ought or ought not to come—whether duty
did not clearly indicate the preferableness
of bringing his sister with him, or sending
a note to Miss Ford, and not calling
at all.</p>

<p>He was not in the habit of having difficult
and delicate questions of this kind to decide,
and he had dallied with this one until the
second had arrived in which he must either
pull the bell, and go in and see her, or turn
back, and go away without seeing her. At
which moment the latter alternative had
appeared so horrible that he had lost not

<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>

an instant in availing himself of the former
one.</p>

<p>Miss Ford was at home. She had returned
yesterday, said the woman, and asked
him to come upstairs, taking the card he
offered her, as she spoke. He accordingly
followed her till she threw open a door, and
entered a room where it seemed twilight; for
it faced due south, and there was only a pale
reflection to be seen of the westerly glow.</p>

<p>In the window, in a large lounging chair,
he saw a woman’s figure, in a light dress,
which figure had a book in its hands, and
leaned towards the light as if to catch ‘the
last pale beam of even.’ He saw how
she turned as her servant gave her his card,
took it, read it, and rose. Then—he did not
quite know how it was—they were alone,
standing hand in hand, looking at one
another, speechless. In the suddenness and
the greatness of the joy of meeting, they
could not be conventional. They failed
entirely to use the requisite words of polite
surprise and delight which, if promptly

<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>

uttered, conceal so many a throb of joy—so
many a spasm of pain. The ‘Really, what a
surprise! Where do you come from?’ The
answering, ‘Passing through on my way to
England, and could not resist the pleasure of
calling’—none of it all was forthcoming.
The surprise on her side was too real, the
joy on both too intense, to leave room for any
of those prettinesses.</p>

<p>Jerome, looking at her in the softened, yet
still clear light, thought he had never seen
anything half so beautiful, as she stood with
her hand in his, and her eyes fixed with
something like fascination in their gaze upon
his face. At last, he put his other hand upon
hers; and her gaze could no longer meet his
deep look, as he said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>‘Then you are not displeased with me for
coming? You are glad to see me?’</p>

<p>‘Very glad,’ she replied, in a lower tone
still. But it was as if, with the actual sound
of his voice and her own, her presence of
mind deserted her. She felt herself begin to
tremble. Withdrawing her hand from his,

<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>

she sank down again upon her chair, and
pointed to one beside her, saying, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>‘You have left Ems suddenly. I—I
heard of your father’s death, before I left
Trockenau. I did not like to intrude or—or
I would have written; but——’</p>

<p>‘But you have thought of me?’ he said,
looking intently at her half-averted face.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I thought of you,’ replied Sara.</p>

<p>‘I hoped you would, though I do not
deserve that you should. I must explain
why I called. I am on my way home—to
England, that is, with my sister. I have to go
to look after my affairs, such as they are. You
said, when you were talking at Trockenau,
that you would allow me to call when I
passed through Elberthal. Miss Ford—I——’</p>

<p>‘You—yes?’ she asked, for he had paused.</p>

<p>‘I have fought a desperate battle with
myself, to know whether I ought to do what
I most desired to do—whether I ought to
call upon you or not.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>‘Whether you ought. Why not? I do
not understand——’</p>

<p>‘Hear me out!’ he exclaimed; and when
he had spoken those words, he knew that he
must tell her all. There was now no alternative,
in honour and honesty, and he felt a
kind of rejoicing, as if he had won a battle,
nor paused any longer to reflect upon the
means by which it had been gained.</p>

<p>‘And first,’ he added, rising, and standing
before her in the window, looking into her
upturned, wondering face, ‘first let me tell
you, a great change has come over my whole
life. It will never be what I had once hoped
for. With my father’s death I have had to
awaken to disagreeable facts. I find myself
a ruined man.’</p>

<p>‘Ruined?’ echoed Sara, vaguely, hanging
on his words, which came rapidly now, and
with a sort of terse, restrained impetuosity.
‘Ruined, Mr. Wellfield?’</p>

<p>‘Exactly so. I will not trouble you by
going into details of the matter. The simple
fact is that I have been living under a

<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>

delusion. I have never imagined myself
in any other circumstances than those in
which I have always been nurtured. One’s
thoughts turn to the future sometimes, and
in youth often and glowingly, I think. So
did mine. I was no exception to the rule.
Believe me, I never calculated on my father’s
death. That I can say honestly——’</p>

<p>‘No, I am sure of it.’</p>

<p>‘But I should have been more than
human had the thought never crossed my
mind that after his death I should be richer
than I had been—should have more at my
disposal, and should be able more freely to
follow the bent of my own tastes and desires.
He never gave me the least hint that there
was anything false in such an idea. I have
told you of Wellfield—of my old home, to
which I had hoped, more than I knew myself,
to succeed. Lately I had thought of it far
more than formerly, and had imagined myself
very happy there. It is no longer mine.
My father, it seems, sold the place years ago,
and the estate with it, in consequence of his

<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>

own money embarrassments. His speculations
have turned out badly, it seems. No
need to relate how. The money he received
for his father’s house, and the estate they had
lived upon, is gone—utterly gone. It was
the shock of hearing suddenly of this which
brought on the attack of which he died. He
had time to tell me the worst—that I was
houseless, homeless, it may be penniless—this
he told me, advised me to settle things
as well as I could, and then he died.’</p>

<p>There was a concentrated bitterness in his
voice; a contempt which broke through the
calm, soft tones in which he spoke, and
which revealed to his listener an entirely new
side of his character. He said no word of
blame regarding his father, but none the
less was the blame there—trenchant and
biting, if unspoken.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Wellfield!’ was all she could say,
‘your trials have indeed been hard. I knew
nothing of this.’</p>

<p>‘No. And perhaps you are wondering
why I should trouble you with the tale, and

<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>

thinking that it could be no possible concern
of yours——Forgive me,’ he added, in the
same low but vehement voice, as he came
nearer to her, and bent over her chair, ‘I
have no right—I have told you all this story
to show you how destitute I am of all right
to speak to you; but when I first met you—when
you roused me from my selfish self-satisfaction,
and I learned to love and
worship you, as I had never imagined that I
could worship, then I believed that I had to
offer you, not only my whole heart and my
entire devotion, but other things not utterly
unworthy of your just claims; I believed
that I could surround you, as I should have
delighted in doing, with every outward sign
of the love I bore you. All that is gone,
and in its going has carried with it my
hope; for it would be insult for me to ask
your love when I have just learnt that I am
a pauper. But I am not ashamed that you
should know I did love you. Good God! did
love you—that I <em>do</em> love you! That passion
masters me yet, and always will master me.

<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>

Nay, do not speak, do not rebuke me, and
yet—yes, tell me,’ he cried, taking her hand,
‘tell me if you ever could have returned that
love of mine, if I——’</p>

<p>He paused a moment, for he had seen her
face. For one moment he felt as if the
riches of the world were his—as if nothing
could matter now; a triumph, a pride which
no adversity could tame. Let what might
happen. Let him be in rags, and begging
his bread; be compelled to stand aside and
see other men surround her and court her,
he knew now that other eyes she would meet
with a proud indifference, let their power be
what it might; but that his, let his station
sink as low as it might, his could subdue
her.</p>

<p>‘Sara!’ All the fire of his mother’s land
was in his eyes, and all its voluptuous music
in his voice. ‘You love me. You do not
speak, but you tell me so. Look at me!
Let me see it in your eyes once again, Sara,
my love!’</p>

<p>There was exultation in his voice, and the

<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>

exultation thrilled her. His passion over-mastered
her, and almost terrified her, and
yet it was rapture such as she had never
dreamed of. Earth and heaven, with their
deepest secrets, seemed suddenly opened to
her—a flood of light over all.</p>

<p>‘Look at me!’ he exclaimed again, and it
was more of a command than an entreaty.</p>

<p>‘Jerome!’ she said faintly, as he took her
hands with gentle violence from before her
face, and knelt on one knee beside her chair
to do so. His ‘Look at me!’ rang in her
ears; his eyes, which she felt were fixed
upon her, attracted her irresistibly. Why
was she so reluctant, so fearful of looking
up? Perhaps because she knew that when
their glances met her last power of concealment
or resistance would be gone.</p>

<p>‘Sara!’ he whispered, and his voice, so
near and so impassioned, at last compelled
the look he demanded. Was it rapture, or
was it pain—an agony of pain—that she felt?
Was it the anguish of having to confess that
she was mastered, conquered? She did not

<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>

know. As he clasped her in his arms, and
pressed his lips upon her lips, and kissed her
cheek, her hair, her closed eyes, she felt that
it might be heaven indeed, but that her heart
was breaking with the greatness of her joy.
Perhaps to reach heaven—to finally pass
through its inner portals—a heartbreak might
be necessary.</p>

<p>‘Do you remember when I was singing at
Trockenau, and the countess thought I did it
to oblige her?’ he asked presently.</p>

<p>‘Do I remember, Jerome? Shall I ever
forget it? I have listened to no singing
since. I could not, and would not.’</p>

<p>‘I sang <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Adeläida</i>, if you remember?’ he
said, but his eyes dwelt upon her face with
an intentness which she felt to be almost
tyrannous.</p>

<p>‘Yes, and you sang “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ich grolle nicht</i>.”
Why did you sing that?’ she said, with a
kind of faint shudder. ‘It is such a terrible
song.’</p>

<p>‘Why—I do not know. But tell me, was
I right to come to-night?’ he asked, persuasively.

<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>

‘I fought a long battle with
myself, as I told you. I was undecided up
to the very moment of entering the house.’</p>

<p>‘Right, yes! I say you were right, at
least. What if you had gone to England
without coming? What if I had never
known—oh, Jerome, it is horrible to think
of!’</p>

<p>‘For me! I feel that I came to you a
beggar, and that I sit here a king, and with
more than a king’s riches. I cannot
repent.’</p>

<p>‘Did you think there was something
wrong in it?’ she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Wrong, no! Is it wrong to love the sun,
and to go by preference where he shines?
What I felt to be wrong was my coming to
monopolise you—if I could persuade you to
be monopolised by me—just when I have
the least right to do so—when I can only
say, “I love you, and always shall love you,”
but cannot say, “Come and be my wife at
once.”’</p>

<p>‘Knowing that you love me, I can wait,’

<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>

she answered. ‘Surely, the highest and best
kind of love is that which sustains us through
waiting and trouble—not that hideous parody
of love which must not be spoken unless the
lover can say at one and the same time, “I
love you—I have got a house for you, and
enough money to keep you—will you marry
me?”’</p>

<p>‘Rampant philistinism!’ said Jerome. ‘I
had no idea before, that I had so much of it
in me. You read me a lesson.’</p>

<p>‘I will never believe but that your love is
of a different fibre to that, Jerome. Never
reproach yourself with having stolen a march
upon me; but think rather that you have
done a good deed in giving me the right not
only to share all your hopes and fears, but to
say that I share them, and to own to you
that your joy is my joy, and your sorrow my
sorrow.’</p>

<p>He had not seen the case in that aspect
before, but he did not say so. The incense
she burnt before him, of love and a subtle
flattery, was sweet. It intoxicated him.

<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>

From his education and surroundings, he was
incapable of telling himself that he was
‘taking pity’ on any woman. No vulgar
parade of the love she felt for him was
possible; but at the same time his most
intense consciousness at this moment was,
not that a proud, and noble, and good, and
beautiful woman had given her happiness
into his keeping, but that he had been right,
she had loved him—he could bend her to his
will.</p>

<p>Sara broke the pause which ensued by
suddenly asking:</p>

<p>‘Where is your sister? Tell me about
her. What is she going to do while you are
settling all your difficulties at home?’</p>

<p>‘I left her at the Breidenbacher Hof.
Yes, she is with me—my poor little Avice!
What will become of her in England—in
Manchester perhaps, in the smoke and fog,
while I am cooling my heels in a lawyer’s
office?—for there will be no hurry about
attending to my behests, my love. What
she will be amusing herself with while I am

<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>

agreeably engaged in learning how much we
have left to starve upon, I do not know.’</p>

<p>‘Make me a promise!’ said Sara. ‘Show
your devotion and your confidence by an
unconditional promise at this very moment.’</p>

<p>‘I promise, blindly, to do as you command.’</p>

<p>‘Then I command you to leave your sister
here with me, while you go home. When you
are perfectly satisfied that you have found a
place for her, such as you would wish her to
be in, then you can come over here and
fetch her. Till then, let her remain with
me, and try whether she can learn to be
my sister.’</p>

<p>‘Sara, you must be inspired, I believe,’
exclaimed Jerome. ‘I could have asked no
better boon—none as good, for her and for
me. I will not deprecate such generosity.
I take you at your word. Teach her only to
be a little like yourself, and I shall find her
perfect.’</p>

<p>‘You will bring her to me to-morrow
morning, will you not, before you go away?

<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>

What a joy it will be to have her! I know
I shall love her, and I think I can make her
love me; and it will bind your thoughts the
faster to Elberthal,’ she added, looking at
him with a tender smile.</p>

<p>Jerome took one of her hands, and sat
with it in his, as Sara closed her eyes, and
leaned back in her chair, wearied with the
excess of emotion she had gone through.</p>

<p>‘God knows, it is a wrench though, to
find all this wealth of love to-night, and to
have to leave it in the morning,’ muttered
Jerome, darkly.</p>

<p>‘God knows, it is!’ echoed Sara.</p>

<p>‘I have an undercurrent of feeling,’ he
went on, ‘which makes me almost wish I
had never crossed your path, nor linked
your lot with mine. The whole future is
so dark and troubled. You were so happy
and at peace, and your art was all in all to
you.’</p>

<p>‘And you think now, I suppose, that you
will dethrone my art. I think not, Jerome,’
she answered, smiling rather proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah, you challenge me!’ said he, smiling
also, rather mournfully. ‘Never forsake
your art for me, Sara, for I am not worth
it.’</p>

<p>‘You are worthy my best and deepest
love, and I shall give it to you,’ she said,
almost passionately. ‘Jerome, do not trouble
this night with these dark forebodings, and
this self-depreciation. It is something new
in you. I never imagined you troubled with
doubts or difficulties.’</p>

<p>He made no answer, and they sat on thus
in silence for a long time, until at last he
rose.</p>

<p>‘I must go to Avice,’ he said. ‘Good-night,
my love.’</p>

<p>Long after he had gone, Sara sat in her
low chair, unseeing the considerate glances
cast towards her by Mrs. Nelson. She sat,
trying to analyse her own sensations—trying
to discover whether the happiness or the
trouble at her heart was greatest. Once or
twice lately, she had thought that could she
but know certainly that he loved her, or

<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>

did not love her, she would at least have
rest in the knowledge. Now, the knowledge
was hers—his love was hers. But with love,
not calm, but the very reverse, had come.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> morning came, and with it,
according to his promise, Jerome
came to breakfast, bringing Avice
with him. ‘Try to persuade her to be
pleased to stay with me,’ Sara had said to
him, to which he had naturally replied by an
emphatic wonder as to what else than
pleasure his sister possibly could feel at the
prospect.</p>

<p>Sara was restless that morning. She
wandered from her studio to her sitting-room,
and back to her studio again. She
had told Ellen that the gentleman who

<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>

had called last night would come to breakfast
with his sister, and Mrs. Nelson had busied
herself in preparing as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">recherché</i> a repast as
possible, placing fresh flowers on the table,
and making everything look bright and
festive.</p>

<p>‘The gentleman was English, wasn’t he,
Miss Sara?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he was—is, I mean.’</p>

<p>‘Then we’ll show him that we know how
to serve an English breakfast, nice, and
bright, and choice; rather different from
their pots of butter, and baskets of cobs,
and a table-cloth, and a coffee-machine—that’s
about all they give you for breakfast in these
parts,’ said Mrs. Nelson, resentfully, for she
had never got over the disgust she had
experienced in partaking for the first time,
and seeing her young lady partake, of a
German breakfast, in the native boarding-house
style.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the breakfast-table, in the
shady corner of the room, was a refreshing
spectacle; but Mrs. Nelson’s eyes, despite

<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>

her seeming engrossment in her work, kept
wandering towards her mistress, whose restlessness
she had not failed to observe.</p>

<p>‘Only the gentleman and his sister, Miss
Ford?’ she asked tentatively.</p>

<p>‘Yes. And—Ellen!’</p>

<p>‘Ma’am?’</p>

<p>‘I want you to like Miss Wellfield very
much, for she is coming to stay with me, for
several months, at least.’</p>

<p>‘Is she, ma’am? About how old is the
young lady?’</p>

<p>‘About sixteen. Ellen, you know how
I trust your judgment—what confidence I
have in you?’</p>

<p>‘You have often proved it, Miss Sara,
and I hope I shall always deserve it.’</p>

<p>‘I know you will. Well, you will wait
upon us at breakfast, and I wish you to
notice both Mr. Wellfield and his sister well.
I want your opinion about them.’</p>

<p>‘I will do so, Miss Sara,’ said Mrs.
Nelson, to whom such proofs of confidence
on her mistress’s part were by no means

<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>

new. She had been the girl’s closest attendant,
most faithful servant, and most
trusty friend from her earliest infancy. Mrs.
Ford had committed her child to Ellen’s care
on her death-bed. She loved her lady with
the devotion of a mother, and with the dog-like
fidelity, as well, of an old, trusty, conservative
retainer. Sara was accustomed to
consult her upon all imaginable matters, save
only those concerning the toilette, in which,
she told Ellen, her tastes inclined to the
sombre, ‘to the good, old-fashioned dining-room
furniture style, Ellen. Your dress
always reminds me of maroon rep curtains.’
Ellen knew as well as a woman can know,
that there must be something between her
mistress and this Mr. Wellfield of the nature
of a love-affair. How far it had gone, she
did not know. She shrewdly suspected that,
sooner or later, she would hear more on the
subject. It pleased Sara to enlighten her, at
the present moment, on another point.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wellfield has had a great misfortune
lately,’ she said. ‘His father is dead, and he

<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>

has lost his whole property and estate. He
does not know what he may have to live
upon, or if anything will be left. He is
going to England to settle his affairs, and I
have invited Miss Wellfield to stay with me
in the meantime.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ma’am,’ Ellen had just replied, when
the two rings, following quickly one upon the
other, announced the expected visitors.
Ellen went downstairs to admit them. Sara
paced up and down her parlour, thrilling
with the sensation that Jerome was far more
formidable now, when he had her secret in
his keeping, than before, when at best he
could only have guessed it.</p>

<p>They stood within the room. Sara felt
her heart beating and her eyes swimming, but
she discovered where Avice stood, and
holding out her arms said, in a faltering
voice:</p>

<p>‘Has he told you? Will you come to
me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, how good you are!’ sobbed the girl,
springing forward, throwing her arms about

<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>

her neck, and hiding her face on her shoulder.
‘How very good you are!’</p>

<p>That was a pleasant meal, despite the
cloud which hung over them, despite the
unwelcome nature of Jerome’s errand to
Manchester. It was a pleasant, and almost
merry meal; and yet a nervous one, as the
minutes flew relentlessly by, and the time
for departure approached more inevitably.</p>

<p>‘I must see your atelier before I go. I
came here on purpose, you know,’ said
Jerome; ‘and we must go now,’ he added,
looking at his watch, ‘for my time is
short.’</p>

<p>They were alone in the studio. It was
light, but sunless, for it faced north. It was
bare, and yet furnished, like all studios. Two
or three easels stood about—a number of
unfinished canvases—some of the plaster
masks and casts known as ‘gyps;’ and on a
pedestal, a great jar of the blue and grey
pottery they make about Coblenz, full of
roses.</p>

<p>Jerome saw them. ‘I must have one

<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>

of these,’ said he, turning the jar round.
‘Here is one—this Gloire de Dijon—more
than a bud, but not yet fully blown.
That is when a rose is more beautiful than
at any other time. It is just like you,’ he
added, drawing it from the jar, and shaking
the water from it. ‘And now, Sara, what of
the future?’ he added, drawing her to him.
‘Why do you always look at me as if you
were half-afraid of me?’ he added, gazing
down into her fascinated eyes. ‘Avice never
does. Yours is not “perfect love” if it has
not cast out fear.’</p>

<p>‘Avice—you will never have the same
rights over Avice that you have already over
me,’ she replied, tremulously.</p>

<p>Jerome smiled. The sensation he felt was
not one of displeasure. How rapidly his
nature had developed during the last six
weeks, he little knew. His former cool indifference
to most women had passed into passionate
love for one—he did know that.
What he did not know was that his love was
of the masterful kind, not only delighting

<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>

to inspire devotion, but loving to subdue.
He had said, ‘Why do you look half-afraid
of me?’ in an almost reproachful tone, but in
his own mind he did not reproach her with
that shade of fear, or anxiety, or whatever it
might be. He did not understand the weight
and the force of her nature. He measured
what was not shown of it by what was—her
utmost capacities by the devotion and humility
of her love for him. He knew from a
thousand signs and tokens that she was
proud to an exceeding degree, and sometimes
imperious. The knowledge that he had
tamed her, and the deprecating look which
told him that here he was supreme, was sweet—boundlessly
sweet. He would have given
worlds for a week to spare here—a week in
which to inhale these fumes of sweet-smelling
incense.</p>

<p>‘What claims have I over you, that I have
not over my sister?’ he asked, smiling still,
looking down into her troubled grey eyes
with the look which had haunted her ever
since the first time she had met it. ‘Legally,

<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>

I have far fewer claims, for until Avice is of
age, she is as much in my power as if I were
her father; whereas you——’</p>

<p>‘I did not mean legally. I meant morally,
of course; the rights that love gives, Jerome—the
right to my thoughts and wishes, and life
and hopes.’</p>

<p>‘You have the same rights over me,’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘And yet you do not look afraid of me, you
mean. It is different, Jerome. Not that I
am really afraid of you,’ she added, looking
up more confidently. ‘And you said something
about the future,’ she went on, as her
fingers played with the little locket and ring
which hung at his watchguard.</p>

<p>‘Ah, about the future—yes. Will you
trust me, and wait?’</p>

<p>‘Through everything, Jerome, most implicitly,’
she replied, and this time there was
no wavering in the glance which met his,
full, open, and candid.</p>

<p>‘And would you prefer it to be kept quiet,
or made known?’ he added; ‘because I

<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>

wish to do exactly as you please in the
matter.’</p>

<p>‘Let us not mention it,’ she replied slowly,
and with downcast eyes. ‘My friends are
very few, Jerome. Let us have the comfort—you
and Avice and me—of keeping it quite
to ourselves. I hate to think of people speculating
about it.’</p>

<p>‘As you will. But suppose—how shall I
put it? If it is imagined that you are free—Sara,
you must know it is most improbable
that no other man will ever wish to win you.
Some one is sure to fall in love with you, and
then——’</p>

<p>‘It is most unlikely—most improbable,’ she
began, with a deep flush.</p>

<p>‘That any other man in existence should
have the bad taste to admire what I have
found so perfect and so desirable,’ he said,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>‘My life is so quiet. I go out so little.
Now, with Avice as my companion, and you
to think of, I shall go still less.’</p>

<p>‘That is sophistry, Sara. Look at me, and

<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>

tell me you honestly believe that, if you are
supposed to be free, no man will ever care for
you again?’</p>

<p>‘You are cruel to press it so. If such a
thing should happen, it will not be my fault,
and I should know how to set him right on
the subject,’ she said, proudly.</p>

<p>‘Well—so be it! And now, my love, it
must be good-bye, for my time is growing
very short. Stay!’ he added, and he unfastened
from his watchguard a little ring which
hung to it. ‘This was my mother’s betrothal
ring. Take it from me, in token that you
are mine, and I am yours.’</p>

<p>He slipped it upon her finger. It was a
hoop of sapphires—the stones which are emblematic
of steadfastness and faith, and it
had been given by his father to his mother.
With that he took her in his arms, and kissed
her good-bye in a long, sorrowful kiss; then
loosed her and took her to a chair.</p>

<p>‘Stay there,’ said he. ‘It will only make
it worse if you come out. I will send Avice
to you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>He was gone. She knew nothing more
until she felt another pair of arms about her
neck, and heard Avice’s voice choked with
tears:</p>

<p>‘He has gone! What shall I do? Oh
Jerome, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">mein</i> Jerome!’</p>

<p>Then her own tears were loosened. The
girls wept in one another’s arms, and were
comforted.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was not until night, after Avice,
wearied with sorrow and excitement,
had gone to bed, that Sara,
calling Mrs. Nelson to her, said:</p>

<p>‘Well, Ellen, what do you think of my
new arrangement? Are you pleased to have
Miss Wellfield here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed, ma’am. I never saw a
sweeter young lady, nor one that was more
of a real lady. She’s one that it will be a
pleasure to serve.’</p>

<p>‘That is well, and I quite agree with you.
And—Mr. Wellfield?’</p>

<p>There was a pause before Ellen said: ‘It
is much more difficult to judge of a gentleman,

<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>

on the spot as it were; and for a woman,
too. And then he is so much older.’</p>

<p>‘I know. But you must have formed
some opinion of him, Ellen. We never see
anyone strange without some impression
being made on our minds.’</p>

<p>‘He is a noble-looking gentleman,’ said
Ellen, slowly. ‘What piercing dark eyes he
has; and such a presence, and such a voice—such
an air, Miss Sara, if I might say so.
One does not often see such gentlemen,
and——’</p>

<p>‘Well, Ellen?’ said her mistress, resting
her chin upon her hand, and looking fixedly
at her, while her heart throbbed. Was he not
all that, and more?</p>

<p>‘I was thinking—Miss Sara, you must
not think me impertinent. You are like my
child, you know.’</p>

<p>‘I know it. Go on.’</p>

<p>‘I was thinking that he has a way and a
look with him that must make it hard for any
woman to withstand him, supposing he were
making love to her.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>‘And is that all?’ Sara asked, almost
indignantly; her heart falling, though she
was herself at the moment so strongly under
the influence of that ‘way’ and that ‘look’—though
he had been making love to her,
and she had found resistance swept away
like a straw down a strong current. ‘Is
that all? Ellen, you know you are
evading my questions. You know that I
want to know whether he looked high-minded
and good.’</p>

<p>‘And that is just what I cannot say, my
dear. I cannot tell. He looks splendid—I
know that. He looks a gentleman, and a very
grand gentleman. And I saw nothing to
make me think he would not be good. But,
since you will know all, Miss Sara, I thought
there was a look about his lips, as if he could
be cruel on occasion.’</p>

<p>‘Cruel, Ellen? What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Nay, don’t look at me in that way, ma’am!
You would make me speak, and I’m bound
to tell the truth, I don’t mean that he
looked as if he would hurt an animal, or wilfully

<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>

torment anything, but he looked to me
as if, supposing he was hard pressed, for
instance, he could be cruel, and unscrupulous—as
if he would gain his end, choose what
he had to do to get to it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Sara, with a somewhat nervous
laugh, ‘you mean that he has a very strong
will. I hope indeed that he has, Ellen, for
he will need it, I assure you.’</p>

<p>‘Then I am very glad he <em>is</em> determined,’
answered Ellen, briskly, as if anxious to have
the subject disposed of. And Sara did not
resume it, but she was that night in no
humour for either work or play. She sat in
her easy-chair beside the table on which
stood her lamp, and thought and pondered
until her brain seemed to ache.</p>

<p>Where was he now? How far advanced
on his dreary way to England and Manchester?
She knew nothing of the north of
England. She only knew that Wellfield,
where his lost home was, was in the north-east
corner of the great manufacturing county,
and that (so he had told her) it was a lovely

<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>

and fertile spot, surrounded on one side by
bleak Yorkshire moors, and on others by
great grimy manufacturing towns. Of course
she had heard of the north of England towns,
had met people who came from them, had
passed through some of them years ago, on
her way to Scotland with her father; but all
that region was a great unknown land to her,
with, as it seemed, the one exception of
Wellfield, which she had found upon an
ordnance map, and had pictured in her heart,
until it took up a great space in her imagination;
and for her ‘the north’ as applied to
England, meant Wellfield. A ridiculous
mental position no doubt, but one not entirely
without precedent.</p>

<p>Well, she thought, he would soon be there.
He had told her he intended to go to see the
old place once again. Mr. Bolton, the new
owner, would not be so churlish as to refuse
him that grace. And he had promised to
write and tell her about it.</p>

<p>‘Cruel?’ she thought, reflecting upon Ellen’s
words. ‘I suppose that means resolute.

<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>

People sometimes have to be almost cruel.
It is often apparent cruelty which is really
the greatest kindness. Jerome could be most
determined, I am certain. I have noticed a
change myself, since—since his trouble. I
daresay he could even be what Ellen would
imagine cruel; but if so, it would be because
he thought it right.’</p>

<p>Meditating upon this thought and variations
of it, she sat until far in the night.</p>

<p>It was several days before the two girls
heard anything of Jerome, and meantime
they were able to become better acquainted
with one another. Sara was predisposed to
love Avice, first because of her charming
appearance, and next because she was
Jerome’s sister. As time went on, the qualities,
mental and moral, of her new sister
made her love her for herself. Avice at first
stood in a little awe of Miss Ford, of her
grand manner, and of her indifferent way of
speaking of things which many persons, and
most women especially, thought of the first
importance. But very soon Sara’s great

<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>

heart and large benevolent woman’s nature
fascinated the younger girl. The whole
character of this new friend was so utterly
different from the character which had
hitherto overshadowed and stunted hers, that
very soon the joy of the new influence pervaded
her whole nature. Here every power
was encouraged to expand to its utmost—here
the cold question, ‘What will persons of
judgment say to it?’ was never asked; only
the question, ‘Is it right or wrong?’ or, by
preference, ‘Is it good and noble, or bad and
base?’ Things were looked at as they were,
not as the world preferred to see them. Here
was liberty in the most alluring guise—that
of a beautiful woman who loved all things
pure and of good report. Avice very soon
began to worship her new guardian.</p>

<p>When at last the first letter from Jerome
arrived, there was little in it of actual news.
He wrote from the house of Mr. Netley, his
father’s solicitor, and said he had only just
arrived there.</p>

<p>‘I found one of his clerks waiting for me

<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>

with an invitation to go to his house, and stay
there until this business is settled and the
worst known. I therefore drove straight up
to his place, which is three or four miles out
of town; and I am writing this before dinner,
while I wait for his return from business.
But I could not wait when once there was
a chance of writing to you.</p>

<p>‘This Cottonopolis is a dismal hole—but
such a rush along the streets. Such earnest,
intent, money-making faces; shrewd, hard
and ugly for the most part. As their
owners bustle along the streets, I feel as if I
were a member of an extinct species, suddenly
resuscitated and plunged into the whirl
of the working half of the nineteenth century—and
I look the thing every inch, I don’t
doubt. I will write to-morrow as soon as
ever I have had a conversation with Mr.
Netley, and know my way a little better.’</p>

<p>He asked her to address everything for
the present to Mr. Netley’s offices, at 57,
Canongate. And he added that he had
rejoiced every hour since his arrival in

<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>

England, to know that Avice was where she
was. ‘Not here—I do not know what would
have become of her here. I think of you
both, constantly, and the thought is as it
were a light unto my feet and a lamp unto
my path. With it, Sara, there may be
poverty and sorrow to contend with, but
there will always be something to live for
and something to hope for. And I say again,
“God bless you!”’</p>

<p>With the receipt of this letter it was as if
one stage of a journey had come to an end.
The door of a former life of luxury and careless
ease had been closed and barred, and
before them all lay a rugged path to be travelled,
and moreover the light that shone
upon it was so vague and uncertain that it
was difficult to follow in its windings.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A LONG</span>, dree journey by that very
unsavoury route to and from the
Continent—Rotterdam and Harwich—and
Jerome Wellfield, on the morning
after his parting from his sister and sweetheart,
found himself in London. He had
nothing to do there—no business in the great
city—no means, no right to take any pleasure
in the same. He made his way from the
Liverpool Street Station to that at Euston
Square, where he found he had some two

<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>

hours to wait before the express to Irkford
should start.</p>

<p>Who does not know the dreariness of such
hours of waiting, weary, travel-worn and
alone, in some great wilderness of a city
station? They were the two most dismal
hours he had ever passed.</p>

<p>At last, at eleven in the forenoon, the train
to Manchester started. Jerome cast himself
into a second-class compartment, and with
weary eyes saw, when he was not half-dozing,
‘the happy autumn fields’ through which the
express rushed smoothly and swiftly, and
with slackened speed at last rolled into that
cheering and inspiriting terminus, the London
Road Station, Manchester.</p>

<p>From Ems—even from Elberthal—to
Manchester! The contrast just flashed across
his mind as he alighted.</p>

<p>A clerk presently accosted him inquiringly,
‘Mr. Wellfield?’ and then gave him a note
which he carried. The note was a kindly,
pleasant one from Mr. Netley, begging him
to go to his house, and make it his headquarters

<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>

until his business in Manchester was
settled. Business prevented him from coming
to the station himself and taking his guest
home, but he would be in to dinner at seven.
The address was given, and he hoped his
clerk would bring word that Mr. Wellfield
was on his way to ‘Birch Lodge.’</p>

<p>With the sensation that this was true
friendliness, Jerome bade the youth tell Mr.
Netley that he accepted his invitation with
many thanks, and, getting into a cab, gave
the address, and was driven to Mr. Netley’s
house—his ‘box,’ as he called it in his
note.</p>

<p>For a bachelor’s box it was remarkably
roomy and comfortable. The housekeeper
had evidently expected the guest, and led him
upstairs to the room prepared for him. Declining
her offer of refreshments, he was left
alone, with exactly two hours on his hands
before dinner-time. Part of the time he
employed in writing that letter to Sara which
has already been spoken of—the rest in meditations,
not particularly agreeable, on his

<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>

‘present condition and future prospects.’
During the few hours he had been in England
he had felt a distinctly stronger chagrin and
disappointment at the idea of the utter loss
of home than he had yet experienced. He
could not understand nor account for this
feeling, but it was there, and it was strong.
He felt a sudden rush of indignation at the
manner in which he had been all these years
cheated and hoodwinked—and that by his
father. This Mr. Bolton, who now reigned
at the Abbey—who and what was he? The
desire to visit the place once more grew
stronger. Wild schemes for becoming rich,
and having the place back again, ran riot in
his mind—chimerical schemes, for, as each
one rose and fell, he had to tell himself
again and again that each was vanity. In
England—in this part of England especially—the
way in which men made fortunes was
that of trade and successful speculation. He
knew absolutely nothing of trade, and had
not the remotest idea in what ‘speculation’
consisted. He saw no way at all of becoming

<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>

rich. He saw the most probable and the
best fate he could expect rise up and stand
very clearly before his mental eyes—a secretaryship,
clerkship, or something of that kind—neither
of them avocations in which, as a
rule, money is very rapidly accumulated.</p>

<p>In the midst of these agreeable meditations
the dinner-bell rang, and he went downstairs
and found his host standing in the hall, looking
out for him—a grey-haired, round-faced,
pink-cheeked, elderly man, with a bland smile
and an amiable expression.</p>

<p>His appearance for some reason caused
Jerome a kind of shock, he had unconsciously
expected something so different. The climax
of disillusion and commonplace appeared
to have been reached when Mr. Netley,
shaking hands with him and smiling benevolently,
said he was sure Mr. Wellfield
wanted his dinner. With his usual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang
froid</i>, Jerome, after a momentary pause,
smiled slightly, and said ‘Yes,’ he was very
hungry. They went into the dining-room,
and here Mr. Netley volunteered the remark

<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>

that he thought business had better wait until
after dinner, to which Jerome again yielded
a cordial assent, and they took their places—Jerome
with an ever-deeper suspicion that
somehow Mr. Netley was not—the only word
he could think of was, ‘sharp’—that, for a
solicitor of his standing, he was decidedly not
very sharp.</p>

<p>‘Have you ever been in Manchester
before?’ asked Mr. Netley.</p>

<p>‘As a child, I may. Never since I grew
up; nor, indeed, in any place like it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! it’s an odd kind of place. Very
thorough-going—strong political views, you
know.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose so. Not that I know anything
about politics; I never took the slightest
interest in them.’</p>

<p>‘No? Not been thrown in the way of
that kind of thing, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all. All my friends have been
musical, or literary, or artistic people—or,
nothing in particular, like myself.’</p>

<p>‘I see. Well, there is a section in Manchester

<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>

that goes in for art, and music, and
that kind of thing. We’ve very fine music
here—concerts, you know—a great many
concerts, in the season.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose everyone has heard that
Manchester is a music-loving town.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly so,’ said Mr. Netley, looking
cheered at this admission. ‘And then there
are literary people too, you know, and
scientific—oh, many scientific people, whom
I don’t know much about. And there are
some artists, too. There’s a School of Art—there
are a great many pupils at the School
of Art, and an exhibition every year of their
paintings.’</p>

<p>‘Only <em>their</em> paintings?’ inquired Jerome,
politely.</p>

<p>‘Oh, and other people’s paintings, of course.
Yes; and a Black and White Exhibition. Do
you care for black and white pictures? Have
you been much thrown amongst black and
white artists—I mean artists who do black
and white pictures?’</p>

<p>‘Not more than amongst artists who do

<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>

red, and green, and blue, and other coloured
pictures in general,’ replied Jerome, beginning
to feel a little amused, and to realise that probably
Mr. Netley was one of those persons who
have one manner and set of expressions for
business hours, and quite another for those of
leisure.</p>

<p>So it proved. When they went into the
library, and Mr. Netley began to talk on
business, it must have been a very clever man
indeed who could have caught him tripping,
or who could have discovered any want of
perspicacity or acumen in his utterances.</p>

<p>They sat together in the study, with cigars
and coffee-cups before them, and Mr. Netley
had pulled out some papers, and begun to
turn them over, when Jerome, whose impatience
had been none the less keen in that
he had so strenuously concealed it, said:</p>

<p>‘Before you go into details, I wish you
could give me one piece of information.
Will there be anything left? Will there be
enough just to give my sister a home? That
is what I am most anxious to know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>‘There will be Monk’s Gate, and I think
from a hundred to a hundred and twenty
pounds’ income. Curate’s pay, Mr. Wellfield,
and a curate might make it do.’</p>

<p>‘You are thinking I am not one. That’s
true. But this is a great relief. And Monk’s
Gate—what is Monk’s Gate?’</p>

<p>‘Your father only sold the Abbey, not
Monk’s Gate.’</p>

<p>‘Monk’s Gate, I conclude, is a house.
I don’t seem to have any remembrance
of it.’</p>

<p>‘It is the little dower-house belonging to
the Abbey. It is close to the large outer
gate—Monk’s Gate they always called it.’</p>

<p>‘I think I remember.’</p>

<p>‘The old fellows used to use that gate.
They went out through it into the fields to
fish in the river. They knew what they were
about, those old grey-frocks. Show me an
abbey that was not built on a site at once
fertile, rich, and beautiful. I defy you,
sir.’</p>

<p>‘There was Whitby—it’s the only one I

<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>

can remember; but it always struck me as
being rather bleak,’ observed Jerome.</p>

<p>‘Well, Whitby, I grant you. But that
was a nunnery. Women like to make themselves
uncomfortable for the sake of religion,
or what they think religion. But that’s
neither here nor there, and if you are ready,
I’ll go a little into detail.’</p>

<p>Jerome absently assented, and Mr. Netley
was privately thinking, with some contempt:</p>

<p>‘He’s the old Wellfields all over again.
Let him only be secure of what will keep
him from absolute beggary, and he’ll sit down
with it, rather than stir a finger. The only
time at which you could arouse that race to a
transient activity, was when they were absolutely
hard-up. When there wasn’t a coin in
the house, they would suddenly drop their
pride, and descend to any expedient to stave
off personal inconvenience and discomfort.
And the most unscrupulous of the whole lot
was this lad’s father. This fellow, it strikes
me, has all the pride and all the laziness of

<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>

the breed, but not their dishonesty, I should
say. Mother’s blood, perhaps.’</p>

<p>Jerome must have been gratified indeed,
could he have known his host’s opinion of
him.</p>

<p>There was not very much to be explained.
It seemed that Mr. Wellfield had sold the
Abbey about seven years ago, when Jerome
was nineteen and Avice nine years of age.
Mr. Netley explained about the ways in which
the purchase-money had been invested, and
how the bank failure had come about, which
had brought the crash. He was a little surprised,
and his theory as to Jerome’s want
of character was shaken, when the young
man said:</p>

<p>‘It seems to me that in any case, on my
father’s death, I should have been reduced to
poverty, for, had the money been remaining,
I should have made it my first object to regain
the Abbey—if I had had to spend every
farthing to do so.’</p>

<p>‘You would have found it no easy task,
Mr. Wellfield. Mr. Bolton is greatly attached

<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>

to the place, and I don’t think any price
would tempt him.’</p>

<p>Jerome winced—it was galling in the
extreme to have to hear of this man in possession
with so firm a grasp upon what he
had always regarded as his. He hated the
thought, and once again, stronger than ever,
the desire rushed over him to oust the usurper
from his place. And once again succeeded
the recoil, the miserable sense of poverty and
helplessness, of impotency, which made his
temples throb and his blood boil. He sat,
with knitted brows, in moody silence, till at
last he asked abruptly:</p>

<p>‘And this Monk’s Gate—is it habitable?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I should say so. I believe there is
even some antiquated furniture in it.’</p>

<p>‘I shall go over and see it, at any rate,
before I decide upon anything else.’</p>

<p>‘Very well. The key is in my keeping at
my office. You shall have it. You shall
judge for yourself. Meantime, don’t be in
any hurry to leave me. Turn things well
over in your mind before you decide to live

<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>

at Monk’s Gate, or anywhere else. I will do
all I can to help you forward.’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind,’ said Jerome, still
absently, his mind still vaguely reaching out
after some path from his difficulties.</p>

<p>Before going to sleep, he added a postscript
to his letter to Sara.</p>

<p>‘Netley tells me he thinks there will be a
pittance left, which makes my mind easier
with respect to my sister. Ah, my love, I
never realised till this night, the <em>power</em> of
money. The want of it makes me feel unscrupulous.’</p>

<small>MONK’S GATE.</small><br></h2>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was a glorious afternoon in the
beginning of August, on which
Wellfield left Manchester for his
two hours’ journey to Wellfield, to arrive at
which spot he had to pass through some of
the roughest, dirtiest, richest and most prosperous
of the numerous manufacturing towns
of Lancashire.</p>

<p>Burnham was the last of these towns—a
place of great size, great riches, and of an
absolutely stupendous ugliness—a great collection
of ugly, grimy buildings, paved streets,
and ghastly-looking tall chimneys, the whole
planted at the bottom of a hollow which had

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_p218">[218]</span>

once been as fair as valley could be, in the
rough, stony moorland style of sparkling
stream and rugged rock. Even now, when
the veil of smoke permitted one to see them,
high and beautiful hills might be perceived,
blue, calm and eternal. The prospect of
them gave one a longing to ascend them, and
from their summits to breathe an air which
should be free and pure.</p>

<p>After Burnham came one or two little
wayside stations, and then Wellfield. The
railway here ran over a high viaduct, much
raised above the village. Jerome felt his
heart throb as he looked out, and saw below
him on the right, slumbering amid orchard
trees and some fine old elms, some ancient
brown walls, two vast and massive gateways—a
broken line which showed where the
cloisters had formerly run beside the river.
That was the Abbey, which, with its grounds,
took up pretty nearly as much space as all
the rest of the village put together. He saw
the calm river gliding by; then raised his
eyes to where in sturdy pride old Penhull

<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>

stretched his great carcase, shutting all in to
the east. It was a fair land—it was a goodly
heritage, and his heart was bitter within
him.</p>

<p>The train stopped, and he got out and
stood on the platform. He was a stranger
there. No one took the least notice of him.
He found himself at the farther end of the
little platform, and before walking forward to
leave the station, he paused and looked
round him. From the place where he now
stood, the Abbey was not visible. He was
looking in another direction, towards the
north-west. Behind him rose the great wall
of Penhull, over which his ancestors in the
good old days had helped King Jamie to
hunt witches with vigour and malignity.
Before him he saw a more level country,
spreading towards an ancient town called
Clyderhow, with its quaint old castle. Farther
to the west came some other long-backed
fells, on the other side of which was St.
George’s Channel: and nearer, on the brow
of one of the said fells, some three miles

<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>

away, he saw faintly the grey tower of an
ancient church, and just above that, where
the ground began to rise towards the western
fells, a long, large, imposing building of
whitish stone, exquisitely situated, and from
its commanding position, a landmark for
miles around. This was the great Jesuit
college of Brentwood, which had once
belonged to a branch of the Wellfield family,
in the days when they were great men and
devout Catholics.</p>

<p>Jerome’s eyes fell upon it, and with the
sight of it came the remembrance of his
having, years ago, met a certain priest belonging
to that establishment.</p>

<p>‘That was more than seven years ago,’ he
reflected, ‘before the Abbey had been sold to
this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roturier</i>. I must have been a mere
lad then, but how well I remember him!
What was his name? Somerville, surely.
Yes. Pablo Somerville. I remember. He
was half Spanish—there was some mystery
about his father, I recollect. What
a musician he was—and a gentleman, if

<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>

ever there was one. Will it be my luck,
I wonder, to renew the acquaintance? One
might meet with a worse fate than some
of those fellows at Brentwood have, after all,
for——’</p>

<p>‘Ticket, sir, please,’ said a curt voice at
his elbow. Jerome roused himself, took his
eyes off Brentwood, and went along the
platform, down a little slanting path, which
brought him into a road. Here he met a
man, and asked him if he knew where Monk’s
Gate was.</p>

<p>‘Dun yo mean th’ heawse, or th’ yate
itsel’?’ inquired the man.</p>

<p>‘I mean the house.’</p>

<p>‘Well, yo’ mun go through th’ yate for to
get to th’ heawse. Yon’s t’ shortest road,’
he pointed down a grassy lane with trees on
either side. ‘Keep down thur, and then
turn to th’ left, and yo’ conna miss th’ Monk’s
Gate, ’cause it straddles o’ across th’ road,
and yo’ mun go under it, and turn in at th’
first gate to your left. Yon’s t’ Monk’s Gate
House. But it’s empty, and locked oop,’ he

<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>

added, looking inquiringly at the person who
had an errand to Monk’s Gate.</p>

<p>‘I know. I have the key.’</p>

<p>‘M’ appen you belong to ’t?’</p>

<p>‘It belongs to me,’ responded Jerome.
‘Good-day, and thank you.’ With which he
walked on, leaving his interlocutor to stare
after him, scratch his head, and remark to
himself:</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m dom’d! It mun be John
Wellfield’s lad. Eh, but I mun go and tell
’em about this ’ere down at th’ Black
Bull.’</p>

<p>Jerome, meantime followed the directions
he had received, and soon found the cavernous-looking
remains of Monk’s Gate, ‘straddling,’
as his guide had said, ‘o’ across t’
road,’ a huge, grim, ivy-covered portal, showing,
by its distance from the rest of what
were now the Abbey grounds, what a great
and glorious possession this said Abbey had
once been.</p>

<p>A little way on the other side of the archway
to the left, was a gate, leading into a

<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>

garden; there was a gravel drive going up
to a low quaint-looking grey stone house.
This, then, must be Monk’s Gate.</p>

<p>It was a wilderness of a garden, with a
large, irregularly shaped lawn, of a velvety
softness and greenness, which neglect had
not yet ruined. In the very centre of this
lawn rose a high, thin old pear-tree. Scattered
about were other kinds of fruit-trees.
Broad borders of all sweet and old-fashioned
flowers were filled with a rank luxuriance of
plants, some blooming, some not yet in
bloom; others almost choked to death by
their more flourishing neighbours. On the
left of the broad walk was a high wall, and
behind the wall fine beech-trees which cast
the shade of their ample boughs far into the
garden of Monk’s Gate. The house itself
stood back; it looked a small house for such
a large, luxuriant garden. It was very low,
Jerome saw, with odd-looking windows half-hidden
by roses and clematis, while all over
the left side of the house, a flourishing ivy
revelled healthily. He approached nearer.

<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>

Just before the house was a great bush of the
Gloire de Dijon rose—the fragrance of its
second crop that year filled the air for yards
around.</p>

<p>Drawing forth the key which Mr. Netley
had given him, he applied it to the door, and
its rattle in the lock was the first sound to
break the almost oppressive hush and stillness,
and deadly calm of everything around
and about. The lock turned somewhat
rustily and unwillingly. It required him to
exert the strength of both his hands to induce
it entirely to yield. Then he pushed the door
open, stepped in, and stood beneath all that
he could now call his own roof-tree. A
narrow passage—a door to the left, which he
passed; the passage was only a few feet
long; one stepped out of it, without door or
other intervening ceremony, into a large, low,
raftered room, with a high old wooden
chimney-piece, deep oaken cupboards sunk
in the walls, a long, very low window, with a
deep, roomy seat in it—a heavy oaken table
in the centre of the room, and, at one side,

<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>

an ancient, shabby, comfortable-looking settee.
In a remote corner there was a pile of old
furniture, which in its dirt and shabbiness
looked remarkably like lumber.</p>

<p>Jerome gazed round the room. Despite
the age and decrepitude of all in it, it had a
certain attraction for him, from its quaint, unconventional
shape and arrangements. The
stairs, with old oaken rails and balustrade,
led straight out of it. A door which he
opened, showed him a roomy kitchen, with a
back-kitchen beyond. Turning back, he
opened the door to the left of the passage,
which he had not yet explored, and found a
second sitting-room, smaller than the first,
but just as quaint, low and irregular. This
room, too, had the agreeable peculiarity of a
corner fireplace, and it contained more furniture
than the other; very old drawing-room
furniture—thin-legged chairs and tables, and
a strange-looking thing which was at once
cupboard, cabinet, and press, to match the
rest of the furniture, which was mahogany.
The aforesaid thin-legged chairs were upholstered

<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>

in a sickly, faded drab damask—relic
of a bygone day. The whole place
looked like some grave, and yet a grave
about which lingered gentle memories, like a
soft perfume; recollections of old-fashioned
ladies who must have spent countless hours
at their tambour-frames, embroidering those
elaborate and now pale and faded semblances
of pink-cheeked shepherds and blue-eyed
shepherdesses which adorned some spindly-looking
stools and spider-legged ‘occasional’
chairs. Whose slender fingers had accomplished
that triumph of worsted-work which
covered a large settee beneath one of the two
little deep square windows—a piece of
worsted-work with a whole picture upon it,
of an elaborate landscape; figures, fountains,
sheep, and marble vases?</p>

<p>Jerome passed his hand across his eyes,
feeling as if he had lost his identity. Was it—could
it be he, Jerome Wellfield, who was
standing in this chill, pale, silent place, inhaling
the faint, musty, dusty smell, which
carries one back full a hundred years; and

<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>

was this dim old place his home—all the
home he now had? He tried to picture
Avice there, and succeeded. It would be no
inappropriate place for her, he felt, when fires
should have dried up all the damp, and when
all this faded furniture should have been pulled
forth, cleaned, and polished, and arranged.
And Sara? Try as he would, he failed to
see her there. And yet, he knew that should
he ask her to come, she would do so.</p>

<p>He climbed the stairs, and found several
bedrooms, corresponding with the rooms
below—all with the same raftered roofs, and
odd little square windows, made almost dark,
too, by the overhanging trailing-plants which
covered the side of the house.</p>

<p>He lingered long, unaccountably attracted
and fascinated. In such a quiet nook a man
might drone out his life, and soon be utterly
forgotten—might live on from year to year,
and watch the seasons come and go, the
flowers bloom and fade, and spring again;
might observe the sunlight and the storm-shadows
sweep across the broad sides of

<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>

Penhull, and might at last die and be carried
to the graveyard which spread around the
old church—might there be laid to his rest,
and none be the wiser.</p>

<p>He shivered slightly, as he vividly pictured
all this; then, slowly descending the
stairs, went out—how hot and balmy the
outside air felt, after the dampness of the
house!—locked the door behind him, and
bent his steps towards the Abbey.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Wellfield</span> had only a very short
distance to walk before he came to
another great cavernous archway,
the ‘Abbot’s Gate,’ and the second principal
entrance to the Abbey. Great beech-trees
clustered around it. It was quite dark and
cool and gloomy, but a little door in the great
wooden gates stood open, and gave him a
curious little oblong glimpse into a sunny
courtyard, where everything stood still and
hot and quiet, and in which, as he stepped
into it, there was not a sign of life. One
side of the Abbey building, what was left of
it, faced him; the windows looked into this

<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>

paved court, and appeared to be windows of
offices, kitchens, etc. Green tubs, filled with
a blaze of scarlet geraniums, made brilliant
spots of colour here and there. To the left
was a high wall, and a fine old stone archway.
He knew the way well. Through that archway
he must pass to go round to the front
entrance of the house, which was chiefly composed
of what had once been the private
apartments of the abbots of Wellfield. He
glanced up at the top of the archway and
saw, on the oblong slab which was let into it,
the legend, ‘J. W., 15—.’ It stood for John
Wellfield, as he knew; the said John having
been the first Wellfield who had taken up his
abode in the Abbey, after its demolishment
under the glorious dispensation of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>‘My initials!’ murmured Jerome. ‘I
wonder this man has not rent out the stone,
and inscribed his own instead.’</p>

<p>This was rather a bitter thought, and, with
his mind full of it, he passed under the archway,
and found himself in a grand old garden

<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>

—such a garden as those ancient monks
knew how to make; and a garden which,
since their time, had been lovingly kept up.
It was formal—all laid out in oblongs and
squares, but it had an indescribable beauty
and grace. Great trees took away from the
stiffness; brilliant flowers and intensely green
grass made it gay. Under the trees to the
right were some clumps of tall, fiery-looking
gladioli. Straight before the house the ground
sloped to the river, beside which was a long
grassy walk and avenue, and a little farther to
the right, still beside the river, the hoary
cloisters. Jerome’s heart was exceeding
bitter within him, as he saw and realised all
the beauty of the place, which came back to
him, after sixteen years, with a familiarity
which was startling. The sixteen years were
but ‘as yesterday.’ As he stood there, he
felt it his—his own; the effort to conceive of
it as belonging to some one else was a painful
one—one which did not altogether succeed.</p>

<p>‘He <em>sold</em> it!’ he was thinking to himself.
‘Sold it in cold blood. Why, if he had told

<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>

us the truth, and kept it, he should have been
happy; we would have made him happy here,
let our poverty have been what it might.’</p>

<p>He walked up the round space of smoothly-rolled
gravel before the deep entrance-door,
and rang the bell.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton, he was told, was at home.
Jerome sent in his card, and was shown into
a room which he well remembered. It had
formerly been the library, and appeared to
be still used for the same purpose, though
greatly changed from its old condition. It
was not very vulgar, indeed one might
almost have pronounced it not at all vulgar;
but all the things were comparatively new,
and evidently ‘of the very best.’ But the
furniture was well chosen and appropriate;
had Mr. Bolton or had his upholsterer chosen
it? Jerome wondered, in a parenthesis as he
looked around, and felt that the appearance
of the room displayed a desire at least, if not
a perfectly accomplished one, on the part of
those who owned it, to be tasteful—a desire
which he felt had resulted in being proper

<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>

and philistine. He glanced at some books
on the table, and at one or two in the book-shelves,
and was struck at finding them to be
nearly all confined to two classes—voyages
and travels, and Italian books, the latter almost
all bearing some reference to Dante, or to
Dante’s great poem.</p>

<p>‘Odd!’ thought Jerome, and as he thought
it, the door was opened, and Mr. Bolton
entered.</p>

<p>A man of medium height, and of moderate
proportions, with a round, obstinate-looking
head, dark complexion, brown eyes, a mouth
with a protruding under-lip, and an all-pervading
expression of shrewdness, and strong,
powerful common-sense. A prejudiced, one-sided
man, one would suppose, but a man
who required a considerable mental space in
which to display his onesidedness and prejudice—a
man with great faults, and great
virtues, possibly; with a bull-dog expression,
betokening tenacity of mind—what this man
once grasped, he would not easily let loose
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>Jerome felt the last fact strongly, if he did
not understand, as indeed he could not possibly
do, the other characteristics. There was
nothing handsome about Mr. Bolton; very
little to be praised in his manner, no grace in
his gestures; but there was a certain rough
dignity about him, which was even imposing.
He was a commanding spirit, if not an enlightened
one.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wellfield, I think?’ he said, fixing
his deep-set, dark eyes upon Wellfield’s face,
but not betraying, by either look or expression,
that he was particularly struck in any
way by his visitor.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Jerome, bowing; ‘I presume
you are Mr. Bolton?’</p>

<p>‘The same. Will you not be seated?’</p>

<p>Jerome had been standing in one of the
windows. At Mr. Bolton’s suggestion he
took a chair, and a feeling curiously akin to
mortification began to steal over him. Mr.
Bolton was so very evidently the master-spirit
here. Wellfield felt himself so entirely reduced
to the level of a stranger—a mere

<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>

casual caller, in his old home, that at first he
could hardly speak.</p>

<p>How was he to introduce himself? How
account for his presence there, for he had
come in his usual half-dreaming manner: with
no set aim or purpose—no clear and tangible
excuse; driven only by a longing to see the
place, and by a half-acknowledged feeling of
defiant unwillingness to be deterred by this
stranger from stepping into the house which
he persistently looked upon as ‘his by right.’
It has been said that when the elder Wellfield
sent his son into the world, he had not overburdened
him with moral maxims for his
guidance. Jerome had been left to decide
upon his own ethical code—a plan which has
its snares and pitfalls as well as its advantages.
Mr. Bolton’s calm presence of mind, and his
evident ease and pleasure in his surroundings,
caused a strange pang to Wellfield, and roused
a feeling of resentment at once unreasonable
and ridiculous. And yet, he felt, he must
be courtesy itself, or all his own feelings
and ideas as to what was his due would not

<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>

prevent the usurper from somewhat unceremoniously
casting him forth.</p>

<p>‘You may think this a strange intrusion on
my part,’ he began, on the spur of the
moment. ‘Indeed, I begin to think myself
that it is.’</p>

<p>‘As to that, I can say nothing, Mr. Wellfield,
until I hear your errand. In the meantime,
I do not think it strange at all that
you should call at the Abbey if you were in
this neighbourhood.’</p>

<p>‘You have no doubt heard of my father’s
death?’</p>

<p>‘I have, and indirectly, of his losses—which,
I suppose, will be your losses. I
was sorry to learn about them.’</p>

<p>Jerome bowed slightly. ‘It is in consequence
of those losses that I am here. I
learnt from Mr. Netley, my solicitor, that the
Monk’s Gate house still belongs to me, and I
came over here to see if it could be made
habitable. I could not resist coming on to see
the old place of all—trusting to your kindness
to allow me to stroll round once or twice.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>‘One can hardly call such a visit a strange
intrusion,’ observed Mr. Bolton, and Jerome
had remarked that though his voice was curt,
and his accent provincial, yet that his language
was proper, and even pedantic sometimes,
and his grammar unimpeachable.</p>

<p>‘You are at liberty to “stroll round,” as
you call it, as much as you please. I don’t
pretend not to know that such an excursion
must be painful to you—if you ever cared for
the place—and from your making this visit,
I conclude you did.’</p>

<p>‘I did, and do,’ answered Wellfield.</p>

<p>‘Then, though it may not be agreeable
to you to know it in the possession of
other people, you will not be sorry to find
that it is as well-cared for as if it were
your own.’</p>

<p>Jerome was not sorry, but he felt galled,
deeply galled, to have to realise so completely
how impotent he was in the matter—how this
man had the power, not only to keep everything
trim, but to alter and change, and upset
everything, if it so pleased him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>‘I am glad to know that,’ he said, and Mr.
Bolton went on.</p>

<p>‘May I ask if you intend to settle at Wellfield?
Do you mean to live at Monk’s
Gate?’</p>

<p>‘So far as I can see at present, I do,’ said
Jerome, who, as a matter of fact, had only
begun to think such a thing advisable, since
he had seen Monk’s Gate. ‘But I do not
know. Mr. Netley gives me to understand
that my sister and I will have something to
live upon. I shall, however, seek employment,
which it is not always an easy
matter to find. Until I do find it, I shall
probably live at Monk’s Gate.’</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton bowed his head. ‘Do you
think of staying here long, now?’ he
asked.</p>

<p>‘I came without any definite intention, for
I did not know what sort of a place Monk’s
Gate was. Now I think I shall go to the
inn here, if there is one, and stay perhaps a
day or two, until I get things in order. And—they
tell me Burnham is a very large town,

<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>

and that trade there is now very good.
Perhaps——’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you are thinking you might happen
to find some employment there. It is possible.
But pray do not think of putting up at the
inn while there is room at the Abbey.
We shall be glad if you will stay with us, as
long as you find it convenient.’</p>

<p>‘Who may we be?’ wondered Jerome, as
he hesitated. There was not much cordiality
in the invitation, but a sedate sincerity, as if
Mr. Bolton performed a duty which might
have been pleasanter, and might also have
been more unpleasant. One thing was quite
certain.  Whether he would be glad or
not to have Wellfield at his own home, he
would be very sorry to see him at the inn.
He saw the hesitation, and repeated his invitation,
this time more cordially.</p>

<p>‘You are very kind,’ said Wellfield. ‘It
looks so very much as if I had come on
purpose——’</p>

<p>‘I do not know why you came, I am sure,
but I trust you will stay with us. Since you

<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>

are so near Burnham, it would be foolish to
go back to Manchester without at least
making an effort to seek some employment
there. And there is no one in the world
who knows so much about Burnham as I
do.’</p>

<p>Jerome thanked him, and accepted the invitation.
Mr. Bolton rose.</p>

<p>‘That is settled,’ he remarked. ‘Come
into the garden, and we’ll find Nita there.’</p>

<p>‘Who is Nita?’ again speculated Wellfield,
and he followed his host without a word.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton took his way through the
garden towards the avenue by the river,
which was called ‘the river walk.’ As they
entered this walk, Jerome perceived in the
distance an arrangement of chairs and a
table, some light shawls, books, parasols, and
two female figures, seated in low cane chairs,
under the trees. Both these ladies were
reading, and apparently engrossed in their
books. The footsteps of the men along
the soft grass made no sound, and neither
lady looked up until Mr. Bolton, in a voice

<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>

from which all hardness and abruptness appeared
to have melted suddenly, said:</p>

<p>‘Nita!’</p>

<p>Then both the parasols were lowered, and
Jerome saw that a very young lady, and a
decidedly elderly one, sat side by side
beneath the trees. The young lady looked
first at both of them, then at Wellfield in
particular, and as she slowly rose, with a
faint, half-smile, her face seemed all large
brown eyes. As he came nearer, he saw
that she had, too, a beautiful forehead, broad,
and rather low; red lips which looked as if
they would readily smile, and pale cheeks.
He saw that she only just attained medium
height; that she was slight, yet not thin in
figure, and graceful, in a certain quaint, picturesque,
unconventional style—a great contrast
to the stiff, upright, elderly figure
beside her, with a grey keen face, compressed
lips, and piercing, cold grey eyes.
The second lady made no attempt at rising.
She sat perfectly still, and bolt upright,
folded her mittened hands one over the other

<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>

upon her book, and looked at Jerome
Wellfield in a manner which he felt to be
pointed.</p>

<p>‘Nita,’ repeated Mr. Bolton, ‘I’ve brought
you a visitor; Mr. Jerome Wellfield, who
will stay with us a short time. My daughter,
Mr. Wellfield, and my cousin, Miss Margaret
Shuttleworth.’</p>

<p>Nita Bolton smiled, shook hands with the
guest, and said, ‘How do you do?’</p>

<p>Miss Shuttleworth stiffly inclined her head,
but did not make any overtures towards
shaking hands.</p>

<p>‘Will you not sit down, Mr. Wellfield?’
said Nita, pointing to a chair, which he took,
and she went on:</p>

<p>‘Have you just arrived in Wellfield?’</p>

<p>‘I arrived about an hour and a half ago.
I have been looking at my house—Monk’s
Gate.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, have you? It is a pretty little
house.’</p>

<p>‘Very. So humble and unobtrusive-looking,’
said Jerome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>‘And damp,’ observed Miss Shuttleworth;
and though she did not speak loudly, she
spoke in a manner which made it impossible to
ignore her remarks. Indeed, whenever Miss
Shuttleworth spoke, an impartial observer
must have said that she put a portentous
amount of expression into her utterances.</p>

<p>‘You think it is damp?’ said Jerome,
politely turning to her, while Nita’s colour
rose, and her fingers trifled nervously with
her watch-chain.</p>

<p>‘I know it to be damp,’ responded Miss
Shuttleworth, in a manner which Jerome,
unaccustomed to her as he was, felt imperatively
called for a reply, or another question
of some kind.</p>

<p>‘So damp as to make it unadvisable to live
there?’ he inquired.</p>

<p>‘I should say it was a most unhealthy
house to live in. If you <em>wish</em> to become
rheumatic at once, and to grow old before
your years, by all means live at Monk’s
Gate.’</p>

<p>‘As it is all the home I now possess,’ responded

<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>

Jerome, ‘it is probable that I shall
live there, despite the disadvantages you
mention.’</p>

<p>‘All the home you possess?’ repeated
Nita, and Jerome turned to her with a sense
of pleasure in the contrast between her and
her relative.</p>

<p>Miss Shuttleworth absolutely revolted him
with her plainness, her hard features, her
metallic voice, and her unengaging manner.
In comparison, Nita, though not a beauty,
looked charming. He met her soft brown
eyes with pleasure, and saw the slight shyness,
the little air of timidity and shrinking,
with feelings of complacency. At this juncture
Mr. Bolton rose, remarking:</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll leave Mr. Wellfield to you to
entertain. I have some writing to do. I
suppose I shall see you at supper, Margaret?’</p>

<p>‘Not to-night, thank you. I have my
Bible class, and shall have to go in about an
hour.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, come to-morrow, or as often as

<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>

you can, at any rate,’ he answered; and with
a general inclination of the head to the company,
he departed.</p>

<p>Jerome looked after him, as he went down
the river walk, and realised that the whole
figure, though plebeian, was powerful, not
without a certain air, too, of dignity and command.
He turned to Nita again.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Bolton has very kindly asked me to
stay a few days at the Abbey, until I have
decided what to do with Monk’s Gate, or
rather until I see whether I can find some
employment, which will allow me to live at
Monk’s Gate, as I hope to do.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Nita, with a look of embarrassment;
‘but—but—I suppose I ought not to
say it——’</p>

<p>‘If it is a personal question, Nita, to a
total stranger, you ought certainly <em>not</em> to say
it,’ here chimed in Miss Shuttleworth’s
voice.</p>

<p>Nita blushed furiously, and Jerome said,
more in the hope of annoying Miss Shuttleworth
than from any other reason:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"> [246]</span></p>

<p>‘I am sure it is no question that is
not perfectly justifiable, Miss Bolton, and
therefore I promise in advance to answer
it.’</p>

<p>‘It was not exactly a question. You speak
of Monk’s Gate as your only home, and of
seeking employment; but I thought you were
rich, Mr. Wellfield.’</p>

<p>‘So did I, until a short time ago. I am
just now in the process of learning completely
to realise my mistake. I am a poor man,
and am not quite certain that the wreck of
my fortunes will leave me enough to enable
me to bring my sister to Monk’s Gate, and
make her a home there.’</p>

<p>‘Have you a sister?’ asked Nita, who kept
giving him very rapid, momentary glances,
her eyes leaving his face almost before they
had had time to find it, which glances he met
with a calm, prolonged gaze, which did
not escape the steely eyes of Miss Shuttleworth.</p>

<p>‘I have a sister—yes.’</p>

<p>‘Is she with you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>‘No; she is at Elberthal, in Germany,
with a friend.’</p>

<p>‘How old is she?’</p>

<p>‘Sixteen.’</p>

<p>‘Is she pretty?’</p>

<p>‘She is considered beautiful, I believe.’</p>

<p>‘Like you at all?’ inquired Miss Shuttleworth,
with a treacherous suavity in her
tones.</p>

<p>Jerome burst out laughing, and Nita
blushed fiercely.</p>

<p>‘Oh, aunt, how uncomfortable you make
me!’ she exclaimed vehemently.</p>

<p>Miss Shuttleworth made no reply, then
Nita went on:</p>

<p>‘I hope it is not rude of me, but are you
and your sister alone in the world?’</p>

<p>‘We are, quite.’</p>

<p>‘And very fond of one another?’</p>

<p>‘Y—yes.’</p>

<p>‘That is, your sister is very fond of you,’
remarked Miss Shuttleworth.</p>

<p>‘I hope she is, and that she may never

<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>

have cause to be otherwise,’ he replied
politely.</p>

<p>‘It is very interesting!’ said Nita, with a
little sigh, while Jerome thought, repressing
a smile, what an amusing story it would make
for Sara and Avice.</p>

<p>‘What is your sister’s name?’ next asked
Nita.</p>

<p>‘Avice.’</p>

<p>‘Avice? What a peculiar name.’</p>

<p>‘It means “refuge,”’ observed Miss Shuttleworth.</p>

<p>‘Oh, does it?’ said Jerome, ‘I didn’t know
that.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think you will like living in
England?’ pursued Nita.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t, under the circumstances.’</p>

<p>She shook her head, and maintained
silence. Miss Shuttleworth rose from her
chair.</p>

<p>‘I must go,’ she remarked. ‘And do you
go in too, Nita, soon. The damp rises from
the river in the evening, and you have a
thin dress on.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>‘I shall not be long.’</p>

<p>‘I am going to take this book with me. It
is a very clever story. Where did you
get it?’</p>

<p>‘John brought it me from London. I
haven’t read it. I saw a review of it
in the ——, which made me think it was
stupid.’</p>

<p>Miss Shuttleworth’s lips relaxed into a
smile which was sardonic. This was a topic
on which she evidently felt strongly.</p>

<p>‘Why do you and John and your father
persist in reading reviews?’ she asked, with
asperity. ‘The book stupid?—as likely as
not it was the reviewer who was stupid.
<em>I</em> know them. It is a very clever book,
but of course if you read that review of
it, it would spoil it for you. I do wish I
could cure you of reading reviews. It spoils
one’s pleasure so, and does not the least
good.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll try to give it up,’ said Nita, meekly.
‘Shall we go with you to the great gate?
Mr. Wellfield, would you like to come?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>Jerome accompanied the two ladies to the
great gate. Then Nita thought she would
walk on with Miss Shuttleworth to her house,
and Jerome thought he would stroll round
the grounds. Nita told him that they supped
at half-past eight, and she disappeared with
Miss Shuttleworth through the gate. Jerome
wandered back along the river walk, and
through the old gardens, and strolled and
loitered amongst the trees. Presently the
sun declined, and gorgeous hues of purple
and gold and crimson set the western sky
ablaze, and coloured the water of the river
with changing tints. The trees waved softly
overhead—the water murmured placidly as it
rolled by. All was still and quiet, and he
tried to realise that he was here—a stranger.
It was all so familiar as to be almost weirdly
so. These strange faces, strange owners,
jarred upon him. He could not understand
how they came to be so at home there—so at
ease in <em>his</em> home. As for him—when he
should have supplied Monk’s Gate with a
little furniture, just enough to make it habitable,

<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>

and established Avice here, his ready-cash
would be almost exhausted, and then
what was to become of him? The pittance—not
certain, but probable—of which Mr.
Netley had spoken, remained. He could not
live upon that—he might die upon it, starve
upon it, go mad upon it; he could not live
upon it—as a man with his ideas, his
hopes, his inborn, inbred habits and feelings,
understands life, even in its narrowest
sense.</p>

<p>After a long time spent in such meditations—meditations
which dimmed the beauty
of the sunset, and marred the evening’s glory,
he looked up, and found that the pomp of
the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Sonnenuntergang</i> was over; the purple and
gold had disappeared; the sky was grey
again. It must be supper-time. He bent
his steps towards the house.</p>

<p>Entering the hall he saw Nita going across
it, with a large crystal bowl of flowers in her
hand. She had on a black flowing dress
of something soft and gauzy, with knots
of brightly-hued ribbons here and there.

<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>

Whether by design or by accident, she had
greatly improved her appearance, and looked
as nearly pretty as it was possible for her to
be; but the air of delicacy and a slight
languor, speaking of a constitution not of
the strongest kind, prevented her from being
really beautiful. But she was agreeable, even
attractive to look at, and had quaint original
little ways which gave a charm to her. If
she did not move with the air of a great
lady, nor shine with the noble beauty of Sara
Ford, she was yet not without her charm, as
Jerome felt, when she paused, balancing the
vase in her hands, looking up at him and
smiling.</p>

<p>‘You have had a long stroll, Mr. Wellfield,
and I am sure you will be tired. William,’
she added, to a page-boy who then appeared
upon the scene, ‘show Mr. Wellfield to the
blue-room, and send Mary to see that he has
all he wants.’</p>

<p>When Jerome came down again, the same
boy appeared, and invited him into the
drawing-room. How well he remembered

<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>

it as he had last seen it, and how great was
the contrast between the dim old room of
sixteen years ago and the luxurious one of
to-day, furnished in the richest and most
approved style, with gorgeously decorated
ceiling, and every kind of ‘upholsterer’s
darling’ in the shape of easy-chairs, couches
and lounges, scattered about!</p>

<p>Nita was there with her work, and Mr.
Bolton with the newspapers, and a third
person, a young man whose face, as Jerome
looked at him, brought back the past with a
vividness, with a rush, as it were, which more
than ever carried him backwards, and made
the immediate past seem like a dream in the
light of sixteen years ago.</p>

<p>‘John Leyburn, if I am in my right mind!’
he exclaimed, for him almost eagerly.</p>

<p>‘I think you may safely assume that your
judgment does not misguide you.’</p>

<p>‘Though you <em>do</em> say that the evidence
of your own senses is the last thing you
would believe, John,’ observed Nita, with
asperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>John laughed, as he shook hands with
Wellfield.</p>

<p>‘Not the last thing I would believe, but
the first thing I would distrust, if I had
grounds for doubting about anything,’ he
answered.</p>

<p>‘And how have you been going on?’ asked
Jerome, after the usual fashion of one man
to another. To which Leyburn replied
modestly:</p>

<p>‘Oh, fairly well.’</p>

<p>‘Fairly well, indeed!’ retorted Nita. ‘You
have got on very well indeed, John. My
cousin has got a big house and a big mill, and
a huge business, all to himself, Mr. Wellfield.
And he calls that getting on “fairly well.”’</p>

<p>‘And you?’ asked Leyburn.</p>

<p>‘I—very ill, as no doubt you have heard.
But that doesn’t matter. I am glad to see
you again. Do you live at Abbot’s Knoll
yet? Do you remember coming down here
to do Latin with my tutor, Phillips? What
an age it seems since then!’</p>

<p>‘I remember,’ said John, deliberately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[255]</span></p>

<p>He was a young man who could not be
called handsome; beside Wellfield he looked
exceedingly plain, with his square-cut, rather
heavy face, and decidedly clumsy figure. Yet
about this young manufacturer, with his want
of grace and polish, there was the charm of a
candid, benevolent, truth-loving nature, which
charm showed in the clear, pleasant light-brown
eyes, which redeemed him from insignificance,
and made him an agreeable companion.
He was quiet, decidedly. Jerome
remembered that in the old days when they
had both been children together, he had
been, not shy, but a silent, reserved, observant
boy, with decided likes and dislikes.
By-and-by, Leyburn went and sat down
beside Nita on the sofa. They appeared to
be on squabbling terms, which naturally implies
intimacy. Mr. Bolton looked benevolently
at them over his newspaper, and
Jerome, with a sudden sense which was not
altogether a pleasurable one, began to wonder
if this were ‘a case.’ No, he did not like the
idea—why, he hardly knew, since it could not

<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>

possibly matter anything to him; but it
seemed to shut him more entirely than ever
out from all that should have been his. With
rapid, unreasonable foresight, he pictured
Nita and her cousin man and wife, in safe
and secure possession of the Abbey and its
lands, with perhaps children to inherit them,
and money in abundance to keep it all up.
The idea galled and hurt him excessively,
and he sat silently, and somewhat moodily
pondering upon it until supper was announced.</p>

<p>It appeared that early hours were the rule
at the Abbey. After supper, Mr. Bolton retired
to one end of the huge drawing-room to
a table on which stood a reading-lamp, and
he was soon lost in a book of travels in the
South Seas. Nita and the two young men
were left to entertain one another as they
chose. Jerome was somewhat taciturn, observing
the incessant conversation, friendly
squabbles and unmistakable real liking
between Nita Bolton and John Leyburn.
About ten o’clock Leyburn said good-night.

<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>

By half-past ten all the household were in
their rooms. Jerome opened his window and
looked out. The same moon, only fuller, as
that which had lighted his meditations in
Manchester, shone here, and silvered the old
Abbey gardens, and the ancient walks, and
the motionless trees. His heart was sore as
heart could be. These people were not
what he had expected, and perhaps that
added to the sting of his vexation. They
were not purse-proud, vulgar upstarts. They
were plain and homely, but gentle and
gracious. It was not some vulgar man who
held and who would inherit his patrimony;
it was a man whose whole character and
aspect compelled respect and even admiration,
and a girl in whose eyes dwelt gentleness
and goodness, and whose ways were all
kind and womanly and girlish. He pondered
over it all, and looked again upon the beauty
of it, and muttered to himself:</p>

<p>‘Mine by right—mine before God! and it
shall be mine again, too.’</p>

<br><br>
<small>NITA’S DIARY.</small><br></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/p258_cap.png" width="75" height="75" alt="Decorated First Letter">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> her room at the same hour sat
Nita Bolton: the door locked, the
lamp lighted. She was attired in
a flowing dressing-gown, her hair falling in
two long, thick plaits over her shoulders.
Nita had beautiful hair—beautiful, that is, in
quality, if not remarkable in colour. It was
of a dull, soft brown, without the suspicion of
a tawny hue in it, or of a glint of gold, but it
was slightly wavy, fine, soft, and abundant,
and she had a harmless pride and pleasure
in it.</p>

<p>She was seated just now at a very elegant-looking
writing-table, an article of furniture

<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>

which had so far been also distinctly an
article of luxury, for Nita’s letters were very,
very few. It was not a letter with which she
was this night engaged. No! Open before
her was a substantially-bound volume, with a
Chubb’s lock, and a little key to open and
close the same—a precaution which lost
some of its value when one considers how
easy it would have been for an evil-disposed
person to carry off the book, lock and all, if
he wished to pry into the sacred contents
thereof. In this precious volume Miss
Bolton was in the habit of inscribing her day’s
adventures, or no-adventures, and her own
valuable comments and reflections thereupon,
together with dark and gloomy musings upon
the sorrows and misfortunes of this present
life; the strange and inexplicable arrangements
of Destiny (with a capital D), and a
chronicle of her mental experiences in
general. Many pages of such lucubrations
filled the earlier portion of the volume.</p>

<p>To-night Anita’s pen had not run with its
accustomed rapidity over the page. She had

<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>

recorded how ‘John returned from London
yesterday morning, and came in in the evening
and brought me some novels, because he
said he knew I cared for nothing else, which
was mean of the dear old fellow.’ How
‘Aunt Margery came to dinner, and sat with
me all afternoon, and was very amusing.
What a clever old thing she is!’ How,
‘about six o’clock, I heard papa’s voice, and
looked up, wondering what had dragged him
away from his beloved Dante, at that hour,
and I saw him coming along with a gentleman,
a stranger, the very handsomest man I
ever saw.’ Then followed a minute description
of the introduction, of every word that
Jerome had said, that Aunt Margery and
papa had said, that ‘I’ had said, and in addition,
what ‘I’ thought on the subject: To
her diary Nita might betray, and did betray
what she would conceal from all others, the
fact that from the moment in which she had
looked up and met Jerome’s eyes, she had
been fascinated, spell-bound, possessed with
the thought of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>Much unpublished as well as published
rubbish is written every year, and Nita
Bolton’s journal was not an exception to the
rule that most young ladies’ journals are not
worth the time that is spent upon them.
Her cousin John having discovered once by
accident that Nita kept a journal, had ever
since oppressed her at intervals with cruel
remarks upon it, questions as to what she
had written about, insinuating inquiries, ‘Did
you mention how agreeable I made myself
the other night?’ and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton had laughed a little when he
heard about it, and had said:</p>

<p>‘She’s dull. Girls must have some outlet
for their feelings. It’s better to sentimentalise
in a diary than with a curate. I’d rather
she sat up late scribbling, than rose at cockcrow
to get cold at “early celebrations,” and
all that rubbish—eh, Jack?’</p>

<p>To which ‘Jack’ always and devoutly
yielded his assent.</p>

<p>Nita, on this particular occasion, had more
and darker reflections to make than usual,

<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>

upon the dark and tortuous ways of ‘Destiny.’
Such effusions might be the result of
a mere surface feeling, or they might be the
indications of some deeper, more tragic
emotion. Who was to say? Nita herself
less than anyone.</p>

<p>‘I never,’ she wrote, ‘<em>never</em> before saw, or
imagined anyone in the least like him. It
was like seeing a new kind of creature.’</p>

<p>Then there was a long pause, as she laid
her pen down, folded her hands, and pondered.
Then she took up her pen again and
wrote:</p>

<p>‘He may well look sad and melancholy,
and gaze sorrowfully on the scene around
him. He may well look long and gravely at
<em>me</em> when he speaks to me. Only quite a
short time ago, he supposed himself the heir
to all this place, and now he is dispossessed,
and it is <em>I</em> who shall sometime have it!
What romances there are in the world, far
wilder romances than one reads of in books.
How will it all end? What hand has
brought us together in this strange manner—I

<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>

and he, of all persons in the world? This
is indeed one of those dark mazes of life
through which one must wander on trust—one
can <em>know</em> nothing.’</p>

<p>Having written thus far, Nita carefully
read over the chronicle, closed and locked
the book, and put it away. Then, starting
with a sudden movement, she ran to the
window, opened it and leaned out, looking
forth upon the moonlight. To a romantic
mind and one given to sentimental musings,
Wellfield Abbey must have been provocative
of much moon-gazing and many reveries.
Nita Bolton was romantic, was sentimental,
in no small degree, though these qualities
had been well kept in check by the healthy
and natural though quiet life which she had
lived, and by the perpetual shafts of satire
directed against all sentiment by her three
associates—her father, her Aunt Margery,
and her cousin, John Leyburn. But the
tendency to weaving romance out of her
surroundings, if they would by any means
allow it, was there, powerful, though dormant.

<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>

The fire smouldered. It needed but a spark
to kindle it. The sudden appearance of
Jerome Wellfield supplied that spark. Nita’s
innate love of sentiment and romance was
aroused. It appeared as if life suddenly contained
a new, fresh interest. It was long
before the girl undressed, and then it was
long before she slept. At last slumber came,
and dreams in which Wellfield had no part.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Morning</span> again—a hazy, glorious
August morning. When Wellfield
threw open his window, a
draught of air scented with everything that
is sweetest and most exquisite was borne
into the room. The heavy trees outside
stood motionless; the dazzling spikes of gladiolus,
and the parterres of geraniums looked
dim in the morning mist which still hung
white and palpable over the course of the
river. Each day that Jerome passed here
was fairer than the last; each morning and
each evening made more palpable to him
what a goodly heritage had departed from

<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>

him, and fallen to the lot of others. This
may have influenced his course: who shall
say what and where is the first upspringing
of that current which, slight at first, presently
grows so strong as to sway our actions and
decide our ‘will’ to some particular course?</p>

<p>On going downstairs, he found the breakfast-table
spread, and Mr. Bolton seated at it.
Nita was standing in the window, the newspaper
in one hand, while the other caressed
the head of her great dun-coloured mastiff,
Speedwell—another dear friend who, like
nature, ‘never would betray the heart that
loved’ him. Mr. Bolton made a measured
apology for beginning his breakfast, adding
that he had to go to Burnham by the nine
o’clock train, but would be in to dinner in the
middle of the day, and he hoped Mr. Wellfield
would do just what was agreeable to
him, and Nita would do her best to entertain
him.</p>

<p>With which Nita also advanced, looking
rather pale, but also almost pretty. She laid
down the paper, remarking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<p>‘There’s nothing in it, papa. The market
is up, and there is a leading article absolutely
annihilating the Opposition, so let that content
you until this evening.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose it must,’ said he, rising; and
wishing them good-morning, he departed.</p>

<p>Nita, when breakfast was over, proposed a
tour round the garden, she had some orders
to give the gardener, and must go to the
farm, or perhaps he would prefer to stay
indoors.</p>

<p>‘I should prefer to go with you if I
may,’ he said; and they strolled out together.</p>

<p>Nita appeared quite at home outside the
house. During their progress round the
garden Jerome grew more interested in her,
and with him, to be interested in a woman
was to do his utmost to make himself interesting
to her. Nita was not aware of this
idiosyncrasy; and a man cannot say to a
woman, ‘Do not make yourself interesting to
me, or I shall try in turn to captivate you.’
The rules of etiquette do not allow such a
statement, but when a man’s heart is given in

<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>

one direction, he may intimate that fact, and
make it quite palpable to another woman,
without absolutely saying in so many words,
‘I am engaged; do not fall in love with me,’
and he may do this without hurting her feelings
or her self-respect. Jerome Wellfield
did not do this.</p>

<p>‘There is a farm belonging to the Abbey,’
observed Nita, ‘and papa leaves all the
management of it to me: he only cares for
his books when he leaves business, so I have
the farm and the gardens and the house—indeed,
everything connected with our life
here—to look after.’</p>

<p>‘Quite alone?’ asked Jerome.</p>

<p>‘Yes; because I have no brothers or sisters,
and very few friends. I am the only
one, and I am glad of it.’</p>

<p>‘Are you? Is it not rather lonely?’</p>

<p>‘I never feel lonely. I don’t know what it
is to feel lonely. And sometimes I think it
is only the heroines of novels who ever do
feel so; but when I once said so to Aunt
Margaret, she said who was I to talk? and

<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>

desired me to wait until I had had a little
more experience of life.’</p>

<p>‘Let us hope you may never have any
experience in that line,’ said Jerome, smiling.</p>

<p>‘Why, do you know what it is to be lonely?’</p>

<p>‘No; I have never felt particularly oppressed
by that sensation. But, talking
about brothers and sisters, I should have
thought you would have been—we won’t say
less lonely, since you take exception to the
term—but would have enjoyed life more if
you had had some of them.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t see it,’ persisted Nita. ‘I am
very happy as I am. I like my own way.
I don’t care to be interfered with. A brother
would take the first place in papa’s heart, and
have the first say in everything; and a sister—no,
I would rather not.’</p>

<p>‘You are exclusive, and contented. Some
day you will have power more undivided
than now, even,’ said Jerome, dwelling with
a morbid persistency on the idea which at
present haunted him. ‘I suppose you like
thinking of that too?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Nita, frankly and unthinkingly,
‘I do; I love to think that I am not going
to leave this dear old place, ever. And I
love to think that some day, though I hope
not for a very long time, it will be my very
own.’</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a smile, as she
finished; met his eyes, read the expression
in them, stopped abruptly, and said, in a
voice of consternation:</p>

<p>‘Oh dear, oh dear!’</p>

<p>Her face was covered with a flood of
colour. For a moment she put her hand
before it, as if to cover it, then dropped it
again.</p>

<p>‘What must you think of me?’ she exclaimed,
in a voice full of tears. ‘Pray forgive
me, if you can!’</p>

<p>‘Pray do not distress yourself,’ he rejoined,
a curious flavour, half bitterness, half amusement,
in his voice—‘I led up to it; I wanted
to hear you confess it. I felt sure you were
too natural not to feel so. You are quite right;
you and yours have not stolen the place.

<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>

You came by it honestly, and have a right to
rejoice in it if you like.’</p>

<p>He made a step onwards, inwardly wondering
a little why he <em>had</em> led up to this
topic. Nita’s face was downcast, as she said,
in a deep tone of annoyance and vexation:</p>

<p>‘It does not matter. I am a little fool, I
believe. After all my resolutions that I
would not drop a syllable that could wound
you while you were here—<em>idiot</em> that I am!’</p>

<p>‘Did you make such resolutions?’ asked
Wellfield, suddenly stopping again, and bending
his eyes beneath their frowning brows
upon her.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Oh, don’t look so severe, Mr.
Wellfield, or I shall have to go in. Indeed
it was an oversight, my saying such a thing.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you would not take it so to heart,’
he said, with a short laugh. ‘It is well that
I should learn to grow accustomed to my
position. You have given me the first lesson,
that is all. Shall we go on?’</p>

<p>Nita answered nothing, but paced on
beside him. Jerome was fully aware in his

<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>

secret heart that his last speech was claptrap;
but if it had the same effect upon Nita as if
it had been fresh from the real well of pathos,
what did it matter? There was a vague
feeling present in his mind, that Nita seemed
to take a good deal of interest in him—a
feeling which gave him suddenly great
interest in her.</p>

<p>‘You are very fond of the Abbey, then?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes—very.’</p>

<p>‘Why so? What makes you like it so
much? Stop! I am sure you need not
give orders to the gardener this very moment.
Take one other turn with me on the river
walk. Why are you so devoted to the
Abbey?’</p>

<p>‘I can hardly tell,’ she answered, a little
shyly. (Evidently she was dreadfully afraid
of hurting him by any second remark like that
one which had already, as it were, exploded
like a conversational bombshell. To her he
was still the lord of the soil, despite her love
for the place, and her keen sense of joy in the

<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>

possession of it. He saw the feeling in a
moment, and it gratified him.) ‘I hardly
know,’ repeated Nita; ‘it seems to have
grown part of my life—it is so different
from other places. It suits me. I was so
glad when we came here.’</p>

<p>‘And you knew when you came that you
were the only child of your father, and you
liked the idea of sometime reigning at the
old place?’ pursued Jerome, tranquilly.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Oh, do please excuse me. I did
like it very much. But if I had known
about you, I should not have liked it; and
I shall not like it now.’</p>

<p>‘Known about me!—you mean that you
were unaware of the existence of such a
person?’</p>

<p>‘No; I had heard of you. But Aunt
Margaret—is a little prejudiced, I think.
She knows all the traditions of the place,
and all the histories of all the old families
in it, and she used to say that—that your
father——’</p>

<p>‘What about my father, Miss Bolton?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>

<p>‘It was not your father in particular. It
was the Wellfield family. She had a dislike
to—no, not a dislike. Aunt Margaret never
has such strong feelings as likes and dislikes.
She said your family were proud and
unscrupulous, that they had never worked
for others, or cared for any but themselves;
that they were—but I have no business to
say such things,’ said Nita, who had by this
time become so nervous and so confused as
not really to know what she was saying, and
who rambled on, fascinated by the calm, pale
face and intent dark eyes of her companion.
She spoke of the old Wellfields as if they had
been a dream, and did not realise that this
man beside her was actually one of the race.</p>

<p>‘Go on, please,’ he said; and Nita continued,
as if it had been a lesson she was
repeating by heart.</p>

<p>‘That they were selfish and luxurious——’</p>

<p>‘The last fault will not be laid to their
charge in this generation, at least,’ observed
Jerome. ‘Well, what else?’</p>

<p>‘I am only saying all this because you

<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>

<em>make</em> me!’ said Nita, with almost passionate
protest in her voice, ‘not because I wish to.
She says—but I will tell you no more. I
will not be so odious. If you really desire
to hear such things, ask Aunt Margaret.
She will tell you, and will not spare anything
on account of your name and your race.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. I shall have a little conversation
with her some day. I can quite
imagine that she thought it was an unmitigated
benefit when the Abbey passed from
the hands of our dissolute race into the
honest and untainted ones of your father.’</p>

<p>‘I knew you would never forgive me, and
yet you would make me go on,’ said Nita, in
a tone of despairing resignation. ‘I can’t
help it. I wash my hands of it.’</p>

<p>‘You at least may “wash your hands in
innocency,”’ he replied. ‘Since my old
home is never to be mine, I would as soon
you had it as anyone; and since you wish
for it more than for anything in the
world——’</p>

<p>‘There is one thing now which I feel

<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>

that I wish for more,’ said Nita, in a vibrating
voice.</p>

<p>‘Is there? What is that?’</p>

<p>‘That you—that those whose home it
really is, should own it once again. I would
gladly leave it now to let you come into it.’</p>

<p>‘That is generously said, and I thank you
for it,’ said Jerome, in a voice not altogether
unmoved. His eyes looked gratefully into
hers. He took her hand, and carried it to
his lips. Nita thrilled from head to foot.
Was this the same world as the world of
twenty-four hours ago?</p>

<p>‘To know that goes as near as anything
can to reconciling me to my inevitable loss,’
he said, still in a low tone, as they resumed
their way.</p>

<p>They left the solitary, silent river walk,
dangerous in its beauty and its associations,
for the more prosaic regions of the kitchen-garden.
While they waited for the gardener
to come, Nita said:</p>

<p>‘Don’t let me keep you here. I shall be
ever so long; and then I have to go to the

<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>

farm. You will want to go down to Monk’s
Gate, I daresay.’</p>

<p>‘I do; but I am emboldened to ask a
favour of you, first.’</p>

<p>‘What is that?’</p>

<p>‘When you have quite finished your business
here, will it be too much to ask you to
come down to Monk’s Gate, and give me a
little advice? There is some furniture in it,
but I don’t know whether it can be used. I
am a man, you see, and naturally helpless in
such a case. If you did not mind very
much——’</p>

<p>‘I shall be delighted. I will come down
as soon as ever I have finished. Shall I find
you there?’</p>

<p>‘You will find me there. If not in the
house, in the garden; and if not in the garden,
in the house. Thank you, very much.’</p>

<p>Lifting his hat he left her, and went down
the river walk.</p>

<p>Adamson, the gardener, found his young
mistress strangely distraite and forgetful—a
phenomenon which puzzled him, for he was

<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>

wont to bear admiring testimony to her clearness
of head, and readiness of comprehension,
saying: ‘Eh, but hoo’s a rare sharp un, is
Miss Bolton. Hoo’s a chip of the ’owd
block in more ways nor one, <em>hoo</em> is.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Wellfield, meanwhile, had taken his way
down the river walk, the entrance to which
was in the village street, close beside the
ancient stone bridge. On the other side of
this bridge, a stony, steep, wood-shaded walk
led invitingly up a hill, then bent round to
the left, leaving the rest of that enticing way
to conjecture. This path, as Jerome remembered,
took one to the top of a hill called
Wellfield Nab or Neb, or simply ‘the Nab.’
He remembered climbing it sixteen years
ago, with his tutor and John Leyburn; and
the glorious view of the surrounding country
which it commanded, he remembered too.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Nab, almost out of sight
from the bridge, he could just catch a glimpse
of a couple of gables, belonging to the Abbot’s
Knoll house—Leyburn’s dwelling. John rode

<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>

every morning to his mill, which was some
two miles distant, on the road to Burnham.</p>

<p>Down the quaint paved street Jerome
walked towards the church, that ancient
‘white church under the hill,’ which had
weathered so many storms and troubles. A
sleepy place, Wellfield—a place which seemed
forgotten of all men save the few who lived
in it.</p>

<p>Monk’s Gate was only a very few minutes’
walk from the church, the clock of which
struck eleven as Jerome opened the gate of
the garden.</p>

<p>He unlocked the door, and went into the
house again, but did not remain there long.
He felt that he really did require Nita’s assistance,
and must wait until she arrived.</p>

<p>The quiet and sunshine of the old-fashioned,
untidy garden were congenial to him. He
wandered about it, inhaling the scent of roses
and carnations, and the rich, spicy odours
of picotees and the old-fashioned white
pink. The sun shone pleasantly upon everything,
doing his best towards ripening the

<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>

young pears and apples on the trees, and
bringing the flowers into more ample bloom.
Where is the charm that can compete with
that which pervades an old-fashioned English
garden?—the flavour of grace and quaintness,
and the suggestions of a ‘gentle life’ which
hang about such a garden are to be found
nowhere else.</p>

<p>Wellfield had turned his back to the gate,
and was looking at the great, blunt, boulder-shaped
head of Penhull, and observing the
purple mist of heather which clothed its
mighty sides, when a voice behind him said:</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wellfield!’</p>

<p>He turned, a curious thrill shooting through
him. The speaker must, he thought, have
almost stolen up to him, so noiseless had
been his approach. He confronted a tall,
spare man, in the dress of an ecclesiastic.
The voice in which he had spoken was soft
and musical; he took off his hat with a smile,
as Jerome’s eyes met his, and the smile was
a singularly fascinating one, giving an expression
of exceeding graciousness and sweetness

<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>

to a pale, finely cut, ascetic-looking countenance.
There was a courtly grace in the
man’s appearance, in his bow and manner.</p>

<p>For a moment Wellfield paused, then,
bowing in his turn, said:</p>

<p>‘Surely I cannot be mistaken—you are
the Father Pablo Somerville whom I met
years ago?’</p>

<p>‘The same,’ he replied. ‘I am glad to
find you remember me. For me, I saw you
as I passed the garden, and concluded it was
you; but had I met you anywhere else, I
should have known you instantly.’</p>

<p>‘Am I so little changed, then?’</p>

<p>‘Not much. And,’ with a slight smile,
‘even had you changed a good deal, yours is
not a face one soon forgets.’</p>

<p>Wellfield held out his hand, saying cordially,
‘I am glad to see you.’ He felt glad. In
Somerville’s presence he felt at ease—felt as
though he were with one of his own kind; a
sensation he had never experienced since
before his father’s death, and which was pleasant
to him, as it is pleasant to return to

<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>

European civilisation, with its beloved and
elaborate shams, after wandering amidst the
primitive and repulsive honesty of savages;
as it is pleasant to return to stove-heated
rooms and a perfumed atmosphere, to rich
meats and dainty wines, after a forced sojourn
amongst bare boards, hard pallets, and a diet
of bread and water. Such exactly was the
sensation experienced now by Wellfield, as
he clasped hands with this high-bred, polished-looking
priest and man of the world.</p>

<p>‘I would ask you into my house, but I
doubt whether there is a chair in it fit to sit
upon. I only arrived here yesterday, and am
surveying now all the home that I have.’</p>

<p>‘The Abbey has passed away from you, as
I heard,’ observed Somerville. ‘That is a
pity, for many reasons. We at Brentwood
at least regret it. In the old days, when
your forefathers belonged to us, Wellfield
Abbey was noted far and wide for the munificence
of its gifts, and the splendour of its
hospitality. Even in the days when your
people were Protestants, they have always

<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>

been gentlemen—Wellfields, despite the Protestantism,
and they have never treated us
churlishly. Down to the last visit of your
late father to the Abbey, we were always
received with hospitality and kindness—then,
especially, for Mrs. Wellfield was there——’</p>

<p>‘My mother!’ exclaimed Jerome, eagerly,
‘Did you ever see her? Were you at the
Abbey then?’</p>

<p>‘It is a long time ago. Twenty-four years
ago. I was a lad of thirteen; and I was even
then destined for the priesthood. I have
been at Brentwood all my life. I was taken
by one of the professors, to call at Wellfield
Abbey, and I remember it well to this day.
It was winter weather, and there were roaring
fires all over the old house. Mr. Wellfield
complained of everything being heated
to furnace-heat. Your beautiful young
mother—and she <em>was</em> beautiful—sat crouching
over a huge fire, with you—a little
infant—swathed in warm shawls, in her arms.
I think all the beauty of her beautiful land
was concentrated in her. What wonder that

<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>

I sat and gazed at her, and thought her like
the Madonna, and wondered how Father
Leigh presumed to talk, and even laugh
with her?’</p>

<p>‘You remember all this!’ exclaimed Jerome,
earnestly. ‘Since I came here, almost every
hour has brought back some incident, some
recollection, some remembered face, which
have made the reverse more cruel, and more
terrible to bear, than I had imagined anything
could be.’</p>

<p>‘I can well believe it. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Autres temps, autres
mœurs.</i> Things are changed now, from that
time of gracious hospitality and high-bred
courtesy. The present owner of Wellfield
Abbey’ (a slight sneer played about the
finely-cut lips) ‘detests “Papists” with a
truly Protestant candour and liberality. I
must say, even if it appear like boasting,
that his bigotry is his misfortune, since the
“Papists” he objects to are the only society
worthy of the name in the neighbourhood.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so,’ said Jerome, whose face
had grown dark during this discourse. He

<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>

was pacing with Somerville up and down the
gravel walk.</p>

<p>‘Yes. The Lathebys of Latheby—do
you remember them?’</p>

<p>‘The name I know well enough. What
of them?’</p>

<p>‘They were formerly on the best of terms
with the Abbey. You must come and see
the exquisite chapel which Mrs. Latheby has
offered to Brentwood. And the Ormes of
Brownhill, and some others—these are the
only gentry, and the only cultivated people
for miles around. But Mr. Bolton does not
care to associate with such popish <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canaille</i>.’</p>

<p>He smiled again, more sneeringly than
before, and Jerome felt his heart warm
towards him. This classification of Mr.
Bolton with one world, and of himself with
quite another, was not unpleasant to him.</p>

<p>‘Many things have happened which go
sorely against the grain with me,’ he rejoined.
‘The mischief of it is, my hands are tied. I
am powerless, because I am moneyless.’</p>

<p>‘I have heard of your losses,’ said Father

<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>

Somerville, ‘and regret them. You will
believe me, Mr. Wellfield, when I say that
we at Brentwood would have welcomed you
back in any case, rich or poor, with the
Abbey or without it, as a gentleman and a
civilised being. We shall welcome you as it
is, if you decide to settle amongst us—welcome
you heartily. And you will think no
wrong when I say that had you been coming
amongst us to take that position which in the
sight of heaven you ought to have, we should
have welcomed you, not more sincerely, but
perhaps more openly and ceremoniously.’</p>

<p>‘You flatter me,’ said Jerome, a flush of
something like pleasure on his cheek. ‘Such
a welcome can by no means be indifferent to
me. As to settling here myself, it seems the
only thing for me to do at present. At any
rate, even if I should have to leave, I shall
bring my sister here, and she will live here.’</p>

<p>‘Your sister! How old is Miss Wellfield,
if I may ask?’</p>

<p>‘Sixteen. She is at present in Germany
with—a friend.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[287]</span></p>

<p>‘I see. When you have settled things,
you will bring her here. And yourself—pardon
these inquiries, and do not answer them if
you think them not allowable, but——’</p>

<p>‘They are more than allowable. They
are very kind; and I feel it a privilege to be
able to speak to you of my affairs,’ returned
Wellfield, with some animation. ‘Myself, I
consider destitute until I have found some
employment. What little remains of my
fortune, I shall devote entirely to my sister’s
use. With strict economy, and in this quiet
place, I may make it suffice for her wants.
They say trade is good. I may succeed in
finding a clerk’s place in some office, in
which a “thorough knowledge of several
foreign languages” is a desideratum, though,
to tell the truth, I should first have to learn
the entire technique of any business I entered.
I should be a bad bargain at first for any
employer, whatever glories I might attain to
later in the matter of book-keeping or correspondence.
Still, I may earn enough to
keep me—what do I know?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>He threw up his head, and laughed a little,
plunging his hands into his pockets. Father
Somerville watched him narrowly and unobserved.
The study pleased him, interested
him, made him curious to pursue it further.</p>

<p>There was a pause till the priest said:</p>

<p>‘If I remember aright, you are a good
musician, Mr. Wellfield.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. It is the only thing I have—the
only talent my God has given me. Of much
use it appears it will be to me!’</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush, sir! As you say, your God
has given it to you, and He doubtless had
some purpose in so endowing you.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon,’ muttered Jerome.
‘It is not my habit to speak in that manner;
but I have been harassed almost to madness
by the embarrassments and difficulties of
my position. Sometimes I have wondered
whether the last Wellfield was sent into the
world to make a name and a fortune on the
stage.’</p>

<p>‘I can well understand your feelings.
Where are you staying?’ he added, suddenly.

<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>

‘At an inn? Will you not come and take
shelter with us at Brentwood. They would
be——’</p>

<p>‘I thank you. I am staying at the Abbey.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, at the Abbey? Then you simply
came down here for a stroll. Will they turn
you out of the Abbey as a polluted thing if
you enter Brentwood to take a meal there?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose they would; but at this
moment I am waiting, and must continue to
wait until she comes, for Miss Bolton, who
has been kind enough to promise me her
assistance in deciding what part of the lumber
inside here is fit to keep and which is good
only to be cast into the fire.’</p>

<p>‘You know Miss Bolton, then?’</p>

<p>‘I made her acquaintance, and that of her
father, yesterday; and they asked me to stay
with them until my business here was done.’</p>

<p>‘Her father is enormously rich.’</p>

<p>‘Is he? I knew he must be rich from the
sum he paid my father for the Abbey. I did
not know his wealth was “enormous.”’</p>

<p>‘But it is, without any exaggeration. He

<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>

has been one of the most successful manufacturers
in Burnham, and does an immense
foreign trade: perhaps your knowledge of
foreign languages might be useful to him.
Knowledge <em>is</em> power, you know, let fools say
what they may against it,’ observed Father
Somerville, who had a way of throwing out
hints which suggested the largest possibilities,
in a casual careless way which was quite
peculiar to him.</p>

<p>‘It is no small thing to be one of the
wealthiest manufacturers of Burnham,’ he went
on. ‘In plain English, it means an income
like that of a nobleman—an income which in
this case is not one quarter spent, but which
goes on accumulating in excellent investments....
And Miss Bolton is sole heiress?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—so I understand,’ said Jerome,
absently, his mind occupied with the priest’s
suggestion that perhaps his knowledge of
languages might prove useful to Mr. Bolton.
Why not? It would be well for him if it
should turn out to be so. The natural indolence
of his half-southern temperament made

<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>

the idea of strenuous exertion in search of
employment, which hardly could in the nature
of things be remunerative, utterly abhorrent
to him; and he grasped with the more eagerness
at the idea suggested by Somerville’s
words.</p>

<p>The latter was tempted to smile at what
at first appeared the obtuseness of the young
man. But he was a man of the world.
Wellfield’s absence of mind, and his unconsciousness
of the hint which lay behind that
remark about the sole heiress, might be an
innocence which would certainly be refreshing
in one who must have been the object of
so much matrimonial angling as Jerome
Wellfield, in the days when he had been the
supposed heir to the Abbey and a fortune;
but it also might not be innocence at all. It
might be that some deeper reason caused that
obtuseness. Probably young Wellfield was
in love already. With his disposition, and
with the life he had led, it was most unlikely
that he should have travelled so far in life
without ever having had his heart touched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>Pablo Somerville knew when to be reserved
and when to be open, even cynically open and
candid. He judged this a fitting occasion on
which to display the latter qualities.</p>

<p>‘She knows it, I should imagine?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Yes—of course, yes. She told me this
morning how pleased she often felt at the
idea of one day owning the Abbey,’ said
Jerome, still not awake to the palpable bearings
of the case.</p>

<p>(‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Quelle bêtise!</i>
—how like a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roturier</i>!’
flashed rapidly through Somerville’s mind;
‘if she likes the Abbey, no doubt she would
like the owner—the once owner!’)</p>

<p>Aloud, he said, striking at once me, and
sharply:</p>

<p>‘Has a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mariage de convenance</i> never occurred
to you as a way out of your difficulties?’
he inquired, in a thoroughly matter-of-fact,
composed tone.</p>

<p>Jerome abruptly came to a dead stop. His
eyes leaped to the other’s face. The priest
looked at him with a slight cool smile, half
rallying, half surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[293]</span></p>

<p>‘Never,’ at last replied Wellfield, almost
frigidly. But his heart was beating fast and
suddenly.</p>

<p>‘I am surprised at that. I should fancy it
would be very easily arranged. And then, if
you really wish for employment, nothing would
be easier than to find it. It is always to be
bought, if you will pay dear enough for
it. Were you but a Catholic, I know
of one—two marriages of that kind, which
might soon be negotiated through our influence.
As it is, I am not Jesuit enough to
pretend that I would connive at marrying a
Catholic heiress to a heretic, even where the
heretic is Jerome Wellfield.’</p>

<p>Jerome laughed a little. ‘It would certainly
be a good deal to expect,’ said he.</p>

<p>‘It would, since you would probably not
only marry the heiress, but convert her, if
you wished to. But why should you not
think of Miss Bolton? You would soon win
her, and, with her, regain your patrimony and
your home.’</p>

<p>He did not expatiate upon the subject.

<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>

Jerome, engrossed by his real love, had absolutely
not once thought of Miss Bolton in
the light in which she was now held up
to him. She was very rich. Some time she
would be the mistress of Wellfield Abbey.
He rather liked her, in a superior, patronising
kind of way, but otherwise she was utterly
indifferent to him; whereas every fibre of his
heart was powerfully drawn in another direction.</p>

<p>‘Impossible, Father! The circumstances
make it out of the question,’ said he, coldly
and decisively.</p>

<p>‘The course is clear,’ said the priest,
calmly. ‘Miss Bolton is not engaged. She
is anything but disagreeable or stupid. Considering
her training, she is a marvel of
refinement; and if you married her you could
make her into what you pleased. You have
no rivals, and if you had, none here who
could for a moment compete with yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me; I know nothing of Miss
Bolton’s feelings, of course, but unless I am
much mistaken I have—should have, I

<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>

mean—a rival in her cousin, John Leyburn,
as good a fellow as ever breathed.’</p>

<p>Father Somerville laughed—laughed as a
man laughs who has heard a jest full of a
quaint conceit which delights him. He had
a musical laugh, and there was nothing offensive
in his manner.</p>

<p>‘A good fellow enough, and liberal minded.
I have encountered him once or twice on
local business. But a girl like Miss Bolton
wants something more than a good fellow for
a husband—something different, at least.
She lives alone, reads novels and poetry, has
known Mr. Leyburn all her life, while you—bah!
my dear sir, the idea of a rivalry is
absurd.’</p>

<p>‘Your imagination is vivid. I say again,
it is out of the question. No. Wellfield is
gone from me, and I must abide without it as
best I may.’</p>

<p>(‘A woman in the case, assuredly,’ thought
the priest, ‘or he would never hesitate. No
Wellfield ever did hesitate at so easy a means
of making himself at ease again. It was

<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>

honest work that always made that race kick
and plunge.’)</p>

<p>Before he could speak aloud the gate had
been opened, and Nita, accompanied by
Speedwell, her mastiff, entered the garden.</p>

<p>‘We must drop that topic,’ murmured
Somerville with a slight smile, as he bowed
low to the girl, who returned the salutation
very slightly, saying with marked coolness of
manner to Jerome:</p>

<p>‘You are engaged, Mr. Wellfield. I am
intruding, and will come another time.’</p>

<p>‘By no means,’ said Somerville, quickly.
‘I must go—I was on the point of taking
leave.’</p>

<p>‘But I shall see you again,’ said Jerome.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, and often, if I consult my own
inclination,’ said Somerville, with his strange,
sweet smile. ‘Call at Brentwood, and ask
for me at any hour after vespers, and I shall
receive you with pleasure.’</p>

<p>Nita, followed by her dog, had walked into
the house while these farewell amenities were
taking place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[297]</span></p>

<p>‘Will you not come to-morrow?’ added
Father Somerville.</p>

<p>‘Thank you. I shall be glad to do so.’</p>

<p>‘That is well. Then, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">auf Wiedersehen</i>!’</p>

<p>He lifted his hat, and was gone. Jerome
entered the house, and found Nita standing
at the window of the larger parlour, motionless,
her eyes fixed upon the retreating figure
of the priest in his long black soutane.
Speedwell, his forepaws upon the window-ledge,
looked too. Nita did not hear Jerome.
She was too absorbed in her watch, but as he
entered, he saw her pat her dog’s head and
heard a low ‘Ss
-s!’ from her lips.</p>

<p>‘Miss Bolton!’ he exclaimed, in astonishment,
while Speedwell’s low, thunderous
growl was exchanged for two deep, angry
barks.</p>

<p>Nita started, turned, and laughed.</p>

<p>‘Are you shocked?’ she said. ‘I do so
hate that man. I call him the “Polished
Panther.” I should not wish to be rude to
him if he is a friend of yours, but for myself,
I cannot stand him, and that is all about it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[298]</span></p>

<p>‘I can hardly call him a friend, though he
is an old acquaintance. Do you know what
post he has at Brentwood?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you know they go through a course.
They don’t keep on teaching the same thing.
I heard the other day that he was teaching
history—Jesuit history, of course, which
proves beyond dispute that the Jesuits
always have been right, ever since the first
one first founded the order, and that everyone
else always has been and will be wrong.
That is what Father Somerville is teaching
at present, I believe.’</p>

<p>‘You speak with heat, and surely with a
little prejudice,’ said he, smiling, but—insensibly
it seemed—his manner towards her had
changed, had taken a shade more of interest,
of familiarity; there was a subtle difference
both in his feelings towards her, and the
behaviour which expressed those feelings.
‘Father Somerville is an accomplished——’</p>

<p>‘Deceiver! Oh yes; I know he is. He
would deceive anyone less clever than himself.
I dislike him exceedingly, and so does

<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>

Speedwell. Well, shall we look at your
furniture, Mr. Wellfield?’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Jerome, accepting the
hint, if hint it were—‘if you don’t mind.’</p>

<p>They began with the room in which they
were standing, and Nita soon displayed capacities
for arranging and settling and turning
things to the best advantage, which perfectly
astonished Jerome. Numbers of things
which he was about to cast aside as being
utterly useless, she quickly reclaimed, remarking
that they only wanted such and such repairs
to make them serviceable and even good.</p>

<p>‘And it would be sinful to throw away a
scrap of this old furniture,’ she added. ‘You
can’t buy any like it except for fabulous
prices, and then you are never sure that you
are not being cheated. I am convinced that for
fifty pounds or so, you may make the house
very nice—at least if you will let me dispose
of the fifty pounds for you,’ she added, colouring
a little; ‘for I am sure you would be
like a child—so helpless—if you went alone
to a furniture shop.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[300]</span></p>

<p>‘I do not doubt it, and would accept your
offer gratefully if I did not think it was imposing
on your kindness.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all. We will drive into Burnham
to-morrow, and see about it,’ replied Nita.
‘Meantime, it is nearly dinner-time, and papa
will be waiting. Shall we go back to the
Abbey?’</p>

<p>Jerome accompanied her to her home, with
new agitation in his breast, and a vague
wonder whether, for the future, Monk’s Gate
were to be his home.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
